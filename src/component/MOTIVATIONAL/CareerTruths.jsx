        <section>
          <h2>1. Get Noticed or Get Ignored</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Reality:</strong> Attention is a currency. If you’re not
            visible, you’re invisible to opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> In a competitive job market,
            visibility equates to credibility. Whether through personal
            branding, public speaking, or project involvement, being noticed is
            vital for career advancement.
          </p>
          <h3>Action Steps:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop a Niche: Become known for specific skills or expertise.</li>
            <li>
              Embrace Visibility Projects: Volunteer for high-profile
              assignments that showcase your capabilities.
            </li>

          <h2>2. Sell Yourself or Sell Yourself Short</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Reality:</strong> If you don’t advocate for yourself, no
            one else will.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Your skills and achievements won’t
            speak for themselves unless you present them confidently.
            Self-promotion isn’t arrogance—it’s a necessity.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
