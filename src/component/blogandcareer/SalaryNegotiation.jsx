        <h2>What to Do During Salary Negotiations</h2>

        <div className="do-point">
          <h3>1. Research Market Rates</h3>
          <p>
            Before entering any negotiation, make sure to research the average salary for the role in your industry and location. Platforms like 
            Glassdoor and PayScale can provide valuable insights into salary benchmarks. This helps you present a realistic range during discussions.
            Remember, creating a <a href='https://resumeera.xyz'><strong>free resume online</strong></a> at ResumeEra also includes optimizing it for the right keywords that align with 
            industry standards.

          <h3>2. Know Your Worth</h3>
          <p>
            Understand the value you bring to the table. Highlight your skills, experiences, and qualifications that justify your expected salary. 
            When crafting your resume, tools like ResumeEra’s <a href='https://resumeera.xyz'><strong>free resume online</strong></a> service help you showcase your strengths in a 
            professional format.

          <h3>3. Practice Your Pitch</h3>
          <p>
            Salary negotiations can be intimidating, so practice your pitch. Be confident, clear, and concise when discussing salary expectations. 
            Use role-playing exercises with a friend or mentor to fine-tune your negotiation approach.

          <h3>4. Be Flexible</h3>
          <p>
            While it's essential to aim for your target salary, be open to negotiating other aspects of the compensation package such as bonuses, 
            health benefits, or remote work options. Flexibility shows that you're committed to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.

          <h3>5. Ask for Time to Consider</h3>
          <p>
            Don't rush into a decision. If you're presented with an offer, it's okay to ask for time to evaluate the full package. This demonstrates 
            that you're thoughtful about the opportunity and want to make an informed decision.

        <h2>What Not to Do During Salary Negotiations</h2>

        <div className="dont-point">
          <h3>1. Don't Settle for Less Than You're Worth</h3>
          <p>
            Never accept an offer just because it’s convenient. If the salary doesn't meet your expectations or reflect your skills, don't hesitate to 
            negotiate. Your <a href='https://resumeera.xyz'><strong>free resume online</strong></a> from ResumeEra already sets you apart; now make sure your salary reflects that.

          <h3>2. Don't Discuss Salary Too Early</h3>
          <p>
            Avoid bringing up salary expectations early in the interview process. Let the employer initiate the discussion at the appropriate stage, 
            usually after they've shown interest in your skills and qualifications.

          <h3>3. Don't Be Afraid to Walk Away</h3>
          <p>
            If the offer doesn't meet your expectations and the employer is unwilling to negotiate, be ready to walk away. There are always other 
            opportunities, and settling for less may affect your job satisfaction in the long term.

          <h3>4. Don't Reveal Your Previous Salary</h3>
          <p>
            Some employers might ask for your previous salary, but it's generally advisable not to reveal this information. Focus on the value you 
            bring to the role and the salary range for that position in the current market.
