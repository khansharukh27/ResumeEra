        <p>There are a lot of benefits to researching potential employers. For one, 
            you’re better prepared for the interview. When the interviewer asks if you have any 
            questions about the role or company, you are able to give more educated answers. Moreover, it 
            becomes much easier to spot red flags about potential employers. If you find that every other review 
            about the company you’re applying for is negative, chances are, they’re not the best employer in the 
            world.</p>
        <p>That said, how, exactly do you research a company? Let’s dive into the top 9 tips to help you out:</p>
      </section>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Start With the Employer’s Website</h2>
          <p>The company’s website is the best starting point to learn about their services, culture, and size. Look for key details such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Products or services they offer</li>
            <li>Company size and growth opportunities</li>
            <li>Work culture and environment</li>
            <li>Dress code or other policies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This knowledge helps you decide if the company aligns with your values and prepares you to ace interview questions about their brand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Find Company Employees via LinkedIn</h2>
          <p>Search for employees on LinkedIn to understand the team structure and reach out politely for 
            insights about the company culture and roles. Connections here can even lead to referrals.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Look Up News About the Employer</h2>
          <p>Search the company’s name in the news to learn about their recent developments, 
            products, or controversies. This keeps you informed and prepared for interview questions.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Check Reviews on Glassdoor</h2>
          <p>Glassdoor is a great resource for understanding the company’s culture, salary ranges, 
            and interview processes based on employee reviews. Watch for red flags like high turnover 
            rates or poor leadership.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Tap Into Your Network</h2>
          <p>Reach out to connections who have experience with the company. This provides you with valuable insider insights and possibly even a referral.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Research Social Media Pages</h2>
          <p>Explore the company’s social media presence to understand their brand voice, communication style, 
            and target audience. Engaging with their posts can also help you get noticed.</p>
            <img src={look_up_companies_on_social_media} alt="look-up-companies-on-social-media" loading="lazy" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Search Social Media Discussions</h2>
          <p>Look for unbiased employee or customer opinions about the company on platforms like Reddit or Twitter by searching relevant keywords.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Prepare for Interviews Using Glassdoor</h2>
          <p>Use the Glassdoor interview Q&A section to find frequently asked questions for roles you’re applying for. This helps you prepare effectively and stand out.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Learn About Salary Averages</h2>
          <p>Platforms like Comparably allow you to find salary averages for the company. Use this data to negotiate a fair salary and avoid being underpaid.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
