                                        <p>Networking is one of the most powerful tools in your job search arsenal. According to recent studies, more than <strong>80% of jobs are never posted online</strong> and are filled through networking. Your connections can introduce you to potential employers, refer you for open positions, or simply share useful career advice.</p>

                                        <h3>Key Benefits of Networking:</h3>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Access to Hidden Job Market</strong>: Many companies prefer internal referrals, and networking gives you access to these opportunities.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Enhanced Credibility</strong>: When someone from your network refers you, it adds an extra layer of trust for the employer.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Industry Insights</strong>: Networking can help you stay updated with industry trends and upcoming job opportunities.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>c) Engage on Social Media:</h3>
                                        <p>Social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter are valuable tools for expanding your professional network. Comment on posts, share industry news, and send personalized connection requests.</p>

                                        <blockquote><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Always send a personalized message when connecting with someone new. A simple note explaining how you found their profile and why you want to connect can go a long way.</blockquote>

                                        <p>Networking events—whether virtual or in-person—are a goldmine for job seekers. Here are tips for making the most out of these events:</p>

                                        <h3>a) Prepare in Advance:</h3>
                                        <p>Research the event, speakers, and participants. Knowing who will attend helps you strategize on who to connect with.</p>

                                        <h3>b) Have Your Elevator Pitch Ready:</h3>
                                        <p>An elevator pitch is a concise summary of who you are, what you do, and what you’re looking for. Make it engaging and practice it until it sounds natural.</p>

                                        <h3>c) Ask Insightful Questions:</h3>
                                        <p>Rather than just talking about yourself, ask questions that show interest in the other person’s work. This will help you build a genuine connection.</p>

                                        <blockquote><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Attend networking events specific to your industry, like tech meetups, business conferences, or startup events.</blockquote>

                                        <p>Failing to follow up after a meeting or event is one of the biggest missed opportunities in networking.</p>

                                        <h3>c) Overloading with Connections:</h3>
