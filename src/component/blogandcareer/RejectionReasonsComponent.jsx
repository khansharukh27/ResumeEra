                <p>Communication is a key factor in interviews, as it shows how effectively you can convey your thoughts and fit into the company’s culture. If you struggle to articulate your thoughts clearly, it can lead to misunderstandings and negatively impact the interviewer’s perception.</p>
                <h3>Do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice clear, concise speaking by preparing common interview questions and answers in advance.</li>
                    <li>Seek feedback on your speaking style from peers or mentors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid using jargon unless absolutely necessary for technical roles.</li>
                    <li>Don’t ignore non-verbal cues like eye contact, body language, and active listening.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A candidate improved their communication skills by practicing mock interviews, leading to a more confident and coherent performance in the actual interview. This small practice change significantly improved their success rate.

                </figure>
                <p>Sometimes, candidates lack the specific experience required for a job. However, showcasing transferable skills and a willingness to learn can make a positive impression even if your experience isn’t an exact match.</p>
                <h3>Do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emphasize transferable skills that relate to the job you are applying for.</li>
                    <li>Show enthusiasm for learning and adapting quickly to new challenges.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid exaggerating your experience or lying about your background.</li>
                    <li>Don’t focus on what you lack; instead, emphasize what you bring to the table.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A candidate with customer service experience highlighted their ability to handle high-pressure situations, which was relevant for a sales role, demonstrating they could adapt and perform well in the job.

                </figure>
                <p>A positive attitude is essential in interviews. A negative attitude can make employers worry about potential issues in the workplace, such as lack of cooperation or morale issues.</p>
                <h3>Do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Express enthusiasm for the role and the company.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a friendly tone and smile where appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid speaking negatively about past employers or experiences.</li>
                    <li>Don’t let stress show in your responses or body language.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A candidate who initially struggled with nerves practiced mindfulness before the interview, which helped them stay positive and engaged, ultimately landing them the job.

                <p>Following up after an interview shows the employer that you’re genuinely interested in the position. Not following up can make you appear indifferent.</p>
                <h3>Do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send a thank-you email within 24 hours of the interview.</li>
                    <li>Express appreciation for the opportunity to interview and reaffirm your interest.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid sending a generic follow-up; personalize it based on your conversation.</li>
                    <li>Don’t overdo it by sending multiple follow-ups in a short time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A candidate who sent a thoughtful follow-up email highlighting specific points from the interview left a lasting impression, which gave them an edge over others.

                <p>Demanding a salary that is too high or too low can give an employer the impression that you haven’t researched industry standards.</p>
                <h3>Do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research average salaries for the role in your location.</li>
                    <li>Be prepared to discuss salary flexibly and professionally.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid quoting a figure without research or understanding the role's requirements.</li>
                    <li>Don’t refuse to negotiate if the initial offer is not exactly what you expected.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Research the company culture and values before your interview.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate through examples how you align with their culture.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Don't:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid assuming that all companies value the same traits.</li>
                    <li>Don’t ignore cultural aspects in your responses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A candidate who highlighted their values around teamwork and integrity connected strongly with a company that prioritized collaboration.
