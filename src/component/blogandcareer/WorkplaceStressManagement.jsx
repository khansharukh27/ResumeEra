        <h2>1. What is Workplace Stress?</h2>
        <p>Workplace stress occurs when the demands of your job exceed your ability to cope. Whether it’s a heavy workload, lack of support, or unclear expectations, stress builds when you feel overwhelmed and underprepared.</p>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), workplace stress arises when tasks or responsibilities don’t align with your skills or resources. The result? A persistent feeling of being stretched too thin.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick Statistics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>83% of U.S. workers report experiencing work-related stress (U.S. Department of Labor).</li>
          <li>94% of employees in the U.S. feel stressed at work at least once a week (BHHC Safety Center).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While a certain level of stress can motivate you to meet deadlines and perform well, prolonged stress can take a toll on your health and productivity.</p>
