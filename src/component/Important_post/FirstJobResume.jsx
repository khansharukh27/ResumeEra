        Crafting a resume for your first job can seem daunting, but it's all about highlighting your skills, education, and enthusiasm. Here’s how to create a resume that stands out, even without much experience.
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">1. Focus on Your Skills</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Even if you lack job experience, you have valuable skills. Think about skills you've developed through school projects, volunteer work, or personal activities. Soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and time management are just as important as technical ones.
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">2. Highlight Your Education</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Education plays a key role in your resume at this stage. Include details about your degree, courses relevant to the job, certifications, or honors. If you have a strong GPA or participated in significant academic activities, mention them.
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">3. Include Internships or Volunteer Work</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Any internship, volunteer work, or part-time jobs you’ve done can be a great way to show employers you’ve gained practical experience. Focus on how these experiences have helped you develop workplace skills.
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">4. Use Action Verbs</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Make your resume more dynamic by using action verbs. Instead of saying "Helped organize a school event," try "Coordinated a successful school event with 100+ attendees."
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">5. Keep It Simple and Clean</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Use a simple and professional resume template. Make sure the formatting is clean with clear headings, bullet points, and plenty of white space to make it easy to read.
      </p>

      <h3 className="first-job-resume-heading">6. Tailor Your Resume to the Job</h3>
      <p className="first-job-resume-text">
        Customize your resume for each job you apply for. Research the company and role, then adjust your resume to reflect how your skills and education match their needs.
      </p>

      <div className="first-job-resume-cta">
        <p className="first-job-resume-summary">
          Your first job resume is your chance to showcase your potential. Highlight your skills, education, and any relevant experience, and tailor your resume to the role you’re applying for.
