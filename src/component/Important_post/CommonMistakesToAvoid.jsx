            <p className="common-mistakes-intro">
                Crafting a resume can be challenging, and it's easy to make mistakes that could hurt your chances of landing an interview. Here are some common resume mistakes to avoid to ensure your resume makes a positive impression.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">1. Spelling and Grammar Errors</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Spelling and grammar mistakes can make your resume look unprofessional and careless. Always proofread your resume multiple times and consider using tools like spell check or asking a friend to review it.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">2. Including Irrelevant Information</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Avoid adding information that does not relate to the job youâ€™re applying for. Focus on skills and experiences that are relevant to the position to make your resume more effective and targeted.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">3. Using a Generic Resume</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                A one-size-fits-all resume is less likely to catch the attention of hiring managers. Tailor your resume to each job application by highlighting the skills and experiences that match the job requirements.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">4. Overloading with Jargon</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                While industry-specific terms can be useful, avoid overloading your resume with jargon that might not be understood by all readers. Strive for clarity and ensure that your achievements are communicated effectively.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">5. Using an Unprofessional Email Address</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                An unprofessional email address can undermine your credibility. Use a simple and professional email address, ideally a combination of your first and last name.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">6. Including Unverified Claims</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Make sure all information on your resume is accurate and verifiable. Avoid exaggerating or including false claims, as this can damage your reputation if discovered.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">7. Using an Inconsistent Format</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Consistency in formatting is key to a professional-looking resume. Ensure uniformity in font size, style, and spacing throughout the document to make it visually appealing and easy to read.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">8. Forgetting to Include Key Information</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Omitting important details like contact information, work experience, or educational background can hurt your chances. Double-check that all relevant sections are included and properly filled out.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">9. Using an Overly Complex Design</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                While a unique design can be eye-catching, overly complex layouts can be distracting. Stick to a clean and professional design that highlights your skills and experiences without overwhelming the reader.
            </p>
            <h2 className="common-mistakes-section-title">10. Neglecting to Include Achievements</h2>
            <p className="common-mistakes-content">
                Focusing solely on job duties without mentioning specific achievements can make your resume less impactful. Include quantifiable accomplishments to demonstrate your value and contributions in previous roles.
            </p>
