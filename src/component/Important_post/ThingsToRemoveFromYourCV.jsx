        <h1>Things to Remove from Your CV</h1>
        <p>
          Crafting a professional CV is essential in today's competitive job market. However, many
          applicants make the mistake of including irrelevant or outdated information, which can
          harm their chances of securing an interview. In this guide, we will cover the things you
          should remove from your CV to make it more appealing to employers.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Irrelevant Work Experience</h2>
          <img src={Irrelevant_Work_Experience} alt="Irrelevant Work Experience" />
          <p>
            While it may be tempting to include every job you've ever had, doing so can overwhelm
            the reader. Instead, focus on work experience that is directly relevant to the position
            you’re applying for. Highlight roles where you developed skills applicable to the job
            you're seeking.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Objective Statements</h2>
          <img src={Objective_Statements} alt="Objective Statements" />
          <p>
            Objective statements have become outdated in modern resumes. Employers know you’re
            looking for a job. Instead of stating your career goals, use that space to showcase your
            professional summary—briefly highlighting your skills and achievements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Personal Information</h2>
          <img src={Personal_Information} alt="Personal Information" />
          <p>
            There’s no need to include personal details like your age, marital status, religion, or
            photograph unless the job application explicitly requests it. Employers focus on your
            skills and qualifications, not your personal life. Including such details could even
            expose you to bias, which you want to avoid.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Outdated or Irrelevant Skills</h2>
          <img src={Outdated_or_Irrelevant_Skills} alt="Outdated or Irrelevant Skills" />
          <p>
            Ensure that the skills you list are up-to-date and relevant to the job you're applying
            for. Listing outdated skills, such as software that is no longer in use, can make your
            resume look old-fashioned. Focus on technical and soft skills that matter for the
            position.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Unprofessional Email Address</h2>
          <img src={Unprofessional_Email_Address} alt="Unprofessional Email Address" />
          <p>
            Make sure your email address is professional. Avoid using nicknames or something
            unprofessional. Ideally, your email should consist of your name (e.g.,
            firstname.lastname@example.com). If needed, create a new email account specifically for
            job applications.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Unnecessary References</h2>
          <img src={Unnecessary_References} alt="Unnecessary References" />
          <p>
            "References available upon request" is an outdated phrase that no longer needs to appear
            on your CV. Employers know that you’ll provide references if they request them, so save
            this space for more important information, like your accomplishments.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Excessive Detail on Early Career</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve been working for over a decade, there’s no need to include extensive details
            about jobs from the beginning of your career. Focus on recent and relevant roles. You
            can summarize older roles in one line if needed, or omit them entirely if they don't add
            value.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Salary Information</h2>
          <p>
            Including your current or previous salary is unnecessary and could hurt your chances of
            negotiation. Leave salary discussions for the interview stage, if it comes up. It’s
            better not to mention salary unless asked.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Hobbies (Unless Relevant)</h2>
          <img src={Unless_Hobbies} alt="Unless Hobbies" />
          <p>
            Unless your hobbies are directly related to the job you’re applying for, it’s best to
            leave them off your CV. Employers are more interested in your professional capabilities
            than how you spend your free time. However, if a hobby showcases skills applicable to
            the job, such as leadership or teamwork, it can be worth including.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>10. Jargon and Buzzwords</h2>
          <img src={Jargon_and_Buzzwords} alt="Jargon and Buzzwords" />
          <p>
            Avoid using overused buzzwords such as “hard-working” or “team player” without context.
            Instead, back up these traits with specific examples from your work history. Let your
            accomplishments speak for themselves.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>11. Lengthy Descriptions</h2>
          <img src={Lengthy_Descriptions} alt="Lengthy Descriptions" />
          <p>
            Be concise in your CV. Long paragraphs can make your resume hard to scan, and recruiters
            typically spend only a few seconds reviewing each one. Use bullet points to keep your
            CV clean and easy to read, focusing on key accomplishments and metrics.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            By removing these unnecessary elements from your CV, you’ll create a cleaner, more
            focused resume that highlights your strengths and makes a strong first impression on
            potential employers. Remember, your CV should always be tailored to the specific job
            you’re applying for, showcasing your most relevant experiences and skills.
