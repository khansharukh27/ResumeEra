      <h1 className="experienced-resume-tips-title">Resume Tips for Experienced Professionals</h1>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-intro">
        As an experienced professional, your resume needs to highlight your accomplishments and showcase your expertise. Here are some key tips to ensure your resume stands out.
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">1. Focus on Results, Not Responsibilities</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        Employers are interested in the impact you’ve made, not just the tasks you performed. Use metrics to demonstrate your accomplishments, such as "Increased team productivity by 25%" or "Led a project that saved the company $500,000."
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">2. Tailor Your Resume for Each Role</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        Even as an experienced professional, you should customize your resume for each job application. Highlight the most relevant achievements and skills that match the requirements of the position.
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">3. Keep It Concise</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        While you may have years of experience, it’s important to keep your resume concise. Aim for 1-2 pages and focus on your most recent 10-15 years of work experience. Use bullet points to make your resume easy to read and scan.
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">4. Highlight Leadership and Management Skills</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        If you’ve held leadership roles, emphasize your management experience. Showcase your ability to lead teams, manage projects, and drive business results. Mention any mentoring or team-building initiatives you’ve been part of.
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">5. Showcase Continuous Learning</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        In today’s fast-paced world, continuous learning is crucial. Include certifications, courses, or workshops you’ve completed, especially those relevant to your field or the job you're applying for.
      </p>

      <h3 className="experienced-resume-tips-heading">6. Use a Modern, Professional Design</h3>
      <p className="experienced-resume-tips-text">
        Your resume’s design should reflect your professionalism. Avoid outdated templates and opt for a clean, modern design with clear sections, consistent fonts, and ample white space. This will ensure that your resume is both visually appealing and easy to read.
      </p>

      <div className="experienced-resume-tips-cta">
        <p className="experienced-resume-tips-summary">
          Your experience is your greatest asset. Focus on measurable results, tailor your resume for each role, and keep the design professional and modern to make a lasting impression.
