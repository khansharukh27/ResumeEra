      <p className="highlight-achievements-intro">
        Highlighting achievements in your resume can set you apart from other candidates. Employers look for measurable successes that demonstrate your impact in previous roles. Here’s how to effectively showcase your accomplishments.
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">1. Focus on Measurable Outcomes</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        Employers are more impressed by results than tasks. Include quantifiable outcomes in your achievements, such as “Increased sales by 20%” or “Managed a project that reduced costs by 15%.” Numbers give context to your impact.
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">2. Use Action-Oriented Language</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        Start your bullet points with strong action verbs like "led," "improved," "created," "designed," or "implemented." This makes your achievements sound dynamic and emphasizes your active role in delivering results.
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">3. Align with the Job You’re Applying For</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        Tailor your achievements to match the job description. Highlight accomplishments that align with the skills and qualifications listed in the posting. This shows that you have relevant experience and can bring immediate value to the position.
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">4. Include Awards and Recognitions</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        If you’ve received any awards, recognitions, or honors in your previous roles, be sure to include them. For example, “Received Employee of the Month for outstanding leadership and team management.”
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">5. Highlight Achievements Across Various Roles</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        If you've held multiple positions, ensure you highlight achievements in each role. This shows consistency in your performance and growth across different responsibilities or companies.
      </p>

      <h3 className="highlight-achievements-heading">6. Showcase Impact in Non-Work Activities</h3>
      <p className="highlight-achievements-text">
        If you're lacking work experience, achievements in volunteer work, school projects, or extracurricular activities can also make a strong impression. Focus on leadership roles or instances where you made a significant impact.
      </p>

      <div className="highlight-achievements-cta">
        <p className="highlight-achievements-summary">
          Highlighting your achievements can make your resume stand out. Focus on quantifiable results, use action-oriented language, and align your accomplishments with the job you’re applying for.
