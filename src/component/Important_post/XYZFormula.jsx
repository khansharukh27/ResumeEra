      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">What is the XYZ Formula?</h2>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">
        The XYZ Formula breaks down your accomplishments into three clear parts:
      </p>
      <ul className="xyz-formula-list">
        <li><strong>X:</strong> What you accomplished – the result or achievement.</li>
        <li><strong>Y:</strong> How it was measured – the impact or result you delivered.</li>
        <li><strong>Z:</strong> What you did – the specific actions you took to make it happen.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">Why Does It Matter?</h2>
