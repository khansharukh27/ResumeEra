            <img src={Stand_out} alt="Need To Know To Stand Out" />
            <h2>1. Self-Marketing</h2>
            <p>Before you start writing your resume, think of it as your personal marketing tool. Identify your top strengths, relevant credentials, and experience. Showcase your most impressive accomplishments to position yourself as the perfect candidate for any job.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Results-Oriented Resumes</h2>
            <p>Employers are not just interested in job titles—they want to know your achievements. Ensure each job description highlights your measurable results, such as increasing sales by a specific percentage or creating a successful project. At ResumeEra, our <a href="https://resumeera.xyz/free-resume-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free resume builder</a> helps you emphasize your achievements effectively.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Prioritizing Key Qualifications</h2>
            <p>Review several job listings and tailor your resume to highlight the top qualifications employers seek. Focus on the top 3-5 qualifications and ensure your resume reflects how you meet or exceed them.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Highlighting Success with Actionable Results</h2>
            <p>Each job description should follow the formula: Actions = Results. This makes your resume more compelling and shows employers exactly how you’ve added value in previous roles. Our <a href="https://resumeera.xyz/online-resume-maker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online resume maker</a> integrates this best practice.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Using Keywords Strategically</h2>
            <p>Research job descriptions for relevant keywords and skills, and incorporate them naturally into your resume. However, avoid keyword stuffing. Instead, sprinkle them throughout your resume in a way that fits seamlessly.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Power of Action Verbs</h2>
            <p>Start each bullet point in your work history with action verbs that demonstrate your contribution. Words like "Led," "Drove," and "Implemented" provide more impact and are preferred by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).</p>
            
            <h2>7. ATS-Friendly Formats</h2>
            <p>To ensure your resume passes ATS filters, avoid creative designs and stick to simple formatting. Use text without tables, images, or graphics, and only submit PDFs if requested. ResumeEra provides <a href="https://resumeera.xyz/online-resume-maker-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATS-optimized resume formats</a> to increase your chances of being seen by employers.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Matching Job Qualifications</h2>
            <p>Apply only for jobs where you meet at least 80% of the qualifications. This shows you're a good fit and avoids the risk of being over- or underqualified.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Emphasizing Soft Skills</h2>
            <p>Employers value soft skills like collaboration, adaptability, and problem-solving. These skills demonstrate your ability to fit into the company culture and should be woven into your resume.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Demonstrating Competencies in Context</h2>
            <p>Avoid listing competencies like "Project Management" without context. Instead, embed them within your work descriptions to demonstrate where and how you've applied these skills. At ResumeEra, we help you build resumes that clearly show your strengths.</p>

            <p>By following these trends, your resume will stand out in 2024. Need help creating the perfect resume?
