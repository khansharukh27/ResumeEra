      <h2 className="employer-resume-expectations-title">What Employers Look for in a Resume</h2>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-intro">
        Employers receive countless resumes, so it's crucial to understand what stands out to them. Here’s what hiring managers are looking for when they review your resume.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">1. Relevant Work Experience</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        The most important factor for employers is relevant work experience. They want to see that you’ve successfully performed similar tasks in previous roles. Make sure to tailor your resume to highlight the experiences that align with the job you're applying for.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">2. Demonstrated Achievements</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        Employers aren’t just looking for a list of duties; they want to see what you achieved. Focus on quantifiable results like "Increased sales by 20%" or "Reduced costs by 15%". Showing measurable success sets you apart from other candidates.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">3. Skills That Match the Job Description</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        Carefully read the job description and highlight the key skills you possess that match the role. This includes both technical skills, such as proficiency in specific software, and soft skills like communication or teamwork.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">4. A Clear and Professional Layout</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        First impressions matter. A resume with a clean, professional format that’s easy to scan will stand out. Ensure your resume is well-organized with clear headings, consistent fonts, and bullet points for quick reading.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">5. Stability and Career Progression</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        Employers want to see growth and progression in your career. A resume that shows upward mobility within a company or industry signals that you’re committed and driven. Avoid frequent job-hopping, as it may raise concerns about stability.
      </p>

      <h3 className="employer-resume-expectations-heading">6. Tailored Content for the Position</h3>
      <p className="employer-resume-expectations-text">
        Sending the same resume to every job application won’t cut it. Employers want to see that you’ve tailored your resume for their specific job opening. Make sure to adjust the language and focus of your resume to match the requirements of each role.
      </p>

      <div className="employer-resume-expectations-cta">
        <p className="employer-resume-expectations-summary">
          To catch the attention of employers, your resume should be tailored to the job, highlight your achievements, and be easy to read. Focus on relevant experience, clear accomplishments, and a professional layout to stand out from the competition.
