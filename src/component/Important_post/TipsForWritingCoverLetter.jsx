            <img src={download_4} alt="how_to_create_coverLetter" />
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">1. Personalize Your Greeting</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Address your cover letter to a specific person whenever possible. Using a personalized greeting, such as "Dear [Hiring Manager's Name]," shows that you've done your research and are genuinely interested in the position.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">2. Start with a Strong Opening</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Begin with a compelling opening that highlights your enthusiasm for the role and briefly introduces who you are. Mention how you found the job posting and why you are excited about the opportunity.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">3. Showcase Your Skills and Achievements</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Highlight your relevant skills and achievements that make you a strong fit for the role. Use specific examples to demonstrate your qualifications and how they align with the job requirements.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">4. Explain Why Youâ€™re Interested in the Company</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Explain why you are interested in working for the company and how your values and goals align with their mission. Showing genuine interest can make a positive impression on the hiring manager.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">5. Keep It Concise and Focused</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Aim to keep your cover letter to one page. Be concise and focus on the most important information that highlights your qualifications and enthusiasm for the position.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">6. End with a Strong Closing</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Conclude with a strong closing statement that reiterates your interest in the position and expresses your eagerness to discuss your application further. Include a call to action, such as scheduling an interview.
            </p>
            <h2 className="cover-letter-tips-section-title">7. Proofread and Edit</h2>
            <p className="cover-letter-tips-content">
                Review your cover letter for any grammatical errors or typos. Ensure it is well-written and professionally formatted. Consider asking someone else to proofread it for additional feedback.
