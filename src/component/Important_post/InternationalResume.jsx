      <p className="international-resume-intro">
        Applying for international jobs requires careful consideration of various factors like cultural differences, resume formats, and language. Here’s how to create an impressive resume that meets international standards.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">1. Research Country-Specific Resume Formats</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        Resume formats vary widely across countries. For example, in the U.S., resumes are usually one to two pages long, while in Europe, CVs are more detailed. Research the typical format used in the country you're applying to. The Europass format is popular in Europe, while CVs in countries like Australia and the UK may require more detail.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">2. Include Language Proficiency</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        If you're applying for a job in a non-native language, be sure to include your proficiency levels in the local language. Use internationally recognized language assessment scales like CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) to describe your language skills accurately.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">3. Tailor to Global Companies</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        Many global companies look for skills like cross-cultural communication, adaptability, and knowledge of global markets. Make sure to emphasize experiences that highlight these skills, particularly if you've worked with international teams or handled global projects.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">4. Use Standardized Terminology</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        While the terminology you use may vary by region, try to use standardized job titles and skill descriptions that are easily understood internationally. For example, "Project Manager" is a common term globally, while more specific roles should be clarified for international recruiters.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">5. Address Visa and Work Permit Status</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        If applicable, mention your visa or work permit status on your resume to reassure international employers that you are legally allowed to work in the country. This can be included in your personal details or a separate section if it's a crucial aspect of the job application.
      </p>

      <h3 className="international-resume-heading">6. Include International Experience</h3>
      <p className="international-resume-text">
        Any experience working or studying abroad is valuable for international job applications. Highlight your international experience, cross-border collaboration, or exposure to different cultures, as this can set you apart from other candidates.
      </p>

      <div className="international-resume-cta">
        <p className="international-resume-summary">
          Creating a resume for international jobs requires attention to cultural differences, language skills, and format preferences. Tailor your resume to the country and company you’re applying to, and emphasize any international experience to increase your chances of success.
