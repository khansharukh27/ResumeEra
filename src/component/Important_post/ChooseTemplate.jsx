      <p className="choose-template-intro">
        A well-chosen resume template can be the difference between making a great first impression and being overlooked. Here’s how to pick the perfect one for you:
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">1. Consider the Industry</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        The design of your resume should reflect the expectations of your industry. Creative industries might welcome unique and colorful templates, while corporate roles in finance or law often prefer a more traditional, minimalist design.
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">2. Align with Your Experience Level</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        If you're just starting out, consider a template with more emphasis on education and skills. For experienced professionals, opt for a format that allows you to highlight work experience prominently.
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">3. Prioritize Readability</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        No matter how stylish a template may be, recruiters will likely pass on resumes that are difficult to read. Choose a template with clear sections and a readable font size.
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">4. Make Use of White Space</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        Templates that are too cluttered or packed with information can be overwhelming. Look for a template that balances content with white space, making your resume easy to scan.
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">5. Check for Customizability</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        It’s important that the template you choose can be easily customized to reflect your unique background. Make sure you can adjust sections, fonts, and colors to match your personal style.
      </p>

      <h3 className="choose-template-heading">6. ATS Compatibility</h3>
      <p className="choose-template-text">
        Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. Ensure your template is ATS-friendly by avoiding overly complex designs, images, and non-standard fonts that might not get parsed correctly.
      </p>

      <div className="choose-template-cta">
        <p className="choose-template-summary">
          Choosing the right resume template is crucial for making a strong impression. Take the time to select one that reflects your industry, highlights your strengths, and is easy to read.
