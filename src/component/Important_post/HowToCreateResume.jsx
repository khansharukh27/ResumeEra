                Select a resume format that best suits your career stage and the job you are applying for. The three most common formats are chronological, functional, and combination. Chronological focuses on your work history, functional highlights skills and abilities, and combination merges both approaches.
            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">2. Write a Strong Summary or Objective</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">

            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">3. Highlight Your Work Experience</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">
                List your work experience in reverse chronological order, including job titles, company names, dates of employment, and key responsibilities. Emphasize accomplishments with specific, quantifiable results to demonstrate your impact.
            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">4. Detail Your Education and Certifications</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">
                Provide information about your educational background, including degrees, institutions, and graduation dates. Include any relevant certifications or training that enhances your qualifications for the job.
            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">5. Showcase Relevant Skills</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">
                List skills that are pertinent to the job youâ€™re applying for. This can include technical skills, soft skills, and industry-specific knowledge. Use keywords from the job description to align your skills with the employer's requirements.
            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">6. Include Additional Sections</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">
                Depending on your background, you might include sections like awards, publications, or volunteer experience. Tailor these sections to highlight experiences that add value to your resume.
            </p>
            <h2 className="resume-guide-section-title">7. Proofread and Edit</h2>
            <p className="resume-guide-content">
                Ensure your resume is free from grammatical errors and typos. Consider having a friend or mentor review your resume for additional feedback. A polished resume reflects your attention to detail and professionalism.
