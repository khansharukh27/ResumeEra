      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-intro">
        A well-formatted resume ensures that your qualifications are easily understood by both hiring managers and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Follow these tips to make sure your resume is formatted correctly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">1. Choose the Right Format</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        There are three common resume formats: chronological, functional, and combination. For most professionals, a chronological resume, which lists your experience from most recent to oldest, is best. Functional resumes focus on skills rather than a work history, and combination resumes blend both.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">2. Use Clear Section Headings</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        Clearly divide your resume into sections like "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Certifications." Make your section headings bold or slightly larger than the rest of the text to ensure they stand out and organize your content neatly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">3. Align Content Properly</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        Left-align all content to maintain consistency and make the resume easier to read. Avoid centering your text except for headings like your name or contact information.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">4. Keep Font Sizes and Styles Consistent</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        Use the same font throughout your resume, and limit your font sizes to 10-12 points for the body text and 14-16 points for section headers. Stick to professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">5. Use Bullet Points to List Achievements</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        Bullet points make it easier for hiring managers to quickly skim through your accomplishments. Use 4-6 bullet points per job role, focusing on your key responsibilities and measurable achievements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">6. Keep Your Resume to One Page (or Two, Max)</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        For most professionals, a one-page resume is sufficient. However, if you have extensive experience or technical skills, a two-page resume is acceptable. Ensure that all content is relevant and avoid unnecessary details.
      </p>

      <h3 className="correct-resume-formatting-heading">7. Save and Submit as a PDF</h3>
      <p className="correct-resume-formatting-text">
        To ensure your resume retains its formatting across all devices and software, always save it as a PDF before submitting it. This prevents any misalignment or font changes that might occur when viewed on different computers.
      </p>

      <div className="correct-resume-formatting-cta">
        <p className="correct-resume-formatting-summary">
          Proper formatting is essential to make your resume look polished and professional. Keep the layout clean, fonts consistent, and structure clear to create a resume that is both ATS and recruiter-friendly.
