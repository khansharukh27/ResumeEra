                    Crafting an impressive resume is essential to getting noticed in today’s competitive job market.
                    Whether you are a fresher or an experienced professional, your resume acts as a personal marketing tool,
                    helping you highlight your skills, experience, and qualifications effectively.
                    Follow these 7 steps to create a resume that stands out and improves your chances of getting hired.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Focus on Your Relevant Experience</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When writing your resume, relevance is key. Too often, job seekers list every job they’ve ever had,
                    but your resume should focus on the experiences most applicable to the job you're applying for.
                    Employers want to see that you have the qualifications they're looking for,
                    so make sure to tailor your resume for each specific role. Start by reading the job description closely,
                    and ensure your bullet points highlight your relevant experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep your resume in reverse chronological order, with your most recent job at the top.
                    While including dates and responsibilities, pay attention to the skills that match the role you're seeking.
                    For instance, if you’re applying for a marketing position, emphasize campaigns you led, marketing tools you used,
                    and measurable outcomes like "Increased social media engagement by 30% in 3 months."
                </p>
                <img src={Relevant_Keywords} alt="Relevant Keyword" />
                <h2>2. Make the First Bullet Your Best</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Research shows that hiring managers spend an average of 6 seconds reviewing a resume.
                    In that brief time, the first bullet point under each job experience is likely the first thing they'll notice.
                    This is why it’s crucial to make that first bullet as strong as possible.
                    Use action verbs like "led," "managed," or "initiated" to demonstrate leadership and initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quantify your achievements whenever possible. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Good example:</strong> "Led a 10-person team to develop and launch a new client onboarding process, reducing the time required by 20%."</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak example:</strong> "Was part of a team that worked on client onboarding."</li>
                    </ul>
                    The more specific you are, the better your resume will resonate with potential employers.
                </p>
                <img src={Bullet_Best} alt="Make the First Bullet Your Best" />
                <h2>3. Demonstrate Your Soft Skills</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Employers are increasingly placing value on soft skills. A report from LinkedIn revealed that communication, leadership,
                    and time management are among the top soft skills recruiters seek.
                    Rather than simply listing these skills, demonstrate them through examples in your work history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, instead of saying "Good communication skills," you could say:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Presented project proposals to C-level executives, gaining approval for a $500,000 investment."</li>
                        <li>"Managed cross-functional teams and led weekly strategy meetings to ensure project milestones were met."</li>
                    </ul>
                    By showing how your soft skills contributed to your success, you're giving potential employers a reason to consider you for the role.
                </p>
<img src={Soft_Skills} alt="Demonstrate Your Soft Skills" />
                <h2>4. Highlight Your Hard Skills</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In many roles, technical skills are just as important as soft skills. Employers expect candidates to be proficient in industry-specific tools and technologies.
                    When listing your hard skills, reference the job description to ensure you are aligning with what the employer is looking for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t forget to include certifications, training, and relevant coursework, especially if you’re entering a new field.
                    For example, if you’ve taken courses in data analytics, digital marketing, or cloud computing, mention those along with any certifications you’ve earned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pro Tip: Consider placing your "Skills" or "Technical Expertise" section higher on the page if the role you’re applying for is highly technical,
                    such as a software developer or data scientist. This helps recruiters quickly see your core competencies.

                <h2>5. Use Relevant Keywords</h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly 75% of large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes before they even reach a human.
                    To pass through these systems, your resume must include relevant keywords from the job description.
                    The key is to use the exact terminology the employer has listed in the posting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the job description mentions "project management software," be sure to list the specific software you've used,
                    such as Trello, Asana, or Microsoft Project. But avoid overloading your resume with keywords – they need to fit naturally within your experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, always upload your resume in Word format when applying online, as ATS systems often reject PDFs.
                </p>
                <img src={Relevant_Keywords} alt="Use Relevant Keywords" />

                <h2>6. Proofread and Edit Thoroughly</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Mistakes on a resume can cost you an opportunity. According to a study, 77% of hiring managers will reject a resume with typos or grammar mistakes.
                    After drafting your resume, take the time to proofread it carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use tools like Grammarly or even ask a friend to review your resume for you. Keep your formatting consistent (same font sizes,
                    use of bullet points, and punctuation), and ensure that it looks clean and professional. Avoid fonts that are hard to read,
                    and stick with classics like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri in size 11 or 12.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Avoid Common Mistakes</h2>
                <div className="addinner">
                    <NewAds/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    One mistake job seekers often make is including a photo on their resume. In fact, 88% of resumes are rejected by ATS systems
                    for this reason alone. Avoid adding unnecessary elements like photos, graphics, or colors that may cause issues with readability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, focus on keeping the format simple and clean. When applying, ensure you have a professional LinkedIn profile picture,
                    as 87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to vet applicants. Your resume and LinkedIn profile should complement each other.

                <h3>Maximizing Your Resume with AI Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, technology can assist in resume optimization. Tools like ChatGPT allow you to improve your resume by generating suggestions based on your job description and resume content.
                    You can prompt AI to help you add missing keywords, refine your bullet points, and even check for grammar and consistency.
