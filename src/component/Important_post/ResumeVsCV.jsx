          A resume is a concise document that highlights your skills, experience, and achievements. Itâ€™s typically tailored to a specific job and is usually no longer than one or two pages.

        <p className="resume-vs-cv-text">
          A CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a more detailed document that provides an in-depth overview of your career, including your education, work experience, skills, and accomplishments. It is typically used in academia, research, and international job applications.
