        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            the question of people that how make resume free and online i resolve this by Resume Era.
          It all started with a simple observation: job seekers were often struggling to present themselves 
          in the best light. Despite having the skills and qualifications, they faced rejection due to poorly 
          structured resumes or generic templates that failed to capture their uniqueness. 
          I knew there had to be a better way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by my background in <strong>HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT,BOOTSTRAPE,FLUX</strong>, 
          I combined my expertise with cutting-edge tools to create ResumeEra—a platform that 
          empowers users to design resumes tailored to specific industries and personal strengths.

        <h2>What I Believe</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that <strong>your resume is more than just a document</strong>—it’s a representation of your 
          story, your achievements, and your future aspirations. A well-designed free resume should not only 
          highlight your skills but also speak to who you are and where you want to go. That’s why I’ve 
          built ResumeEra to be flexible, innovative, and intuitive, giving you the power to create a 
          free resume that speaks for itself.
