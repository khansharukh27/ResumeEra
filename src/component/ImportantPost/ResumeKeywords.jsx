      <h1 className="resume-keywords-title">How to Use Keywords in a Resume</h1>
      <p className="resume-keywords-intro">
        Including the right keywords in your resume is critical for passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and catching the attention of hiring managers. Here’s how to effectively use keywords in your resume.
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">1. Understand the Importance of Keywords</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        Keywords are specific words or phrases that describe the skills, qualifications, and experiences that employers are looking for. They help your resume get noticed by both ATS software and human recruiters. Use relevant keywords to align with the job description.
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">2. Identify Keywords from the Job Description</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        Start by carefully reading the job description. Highlight the specific skills, experiences, and qualifications that are mentioned multiple times. These are likely the keywords you should include. Focus on hard skills (e.g., software proficiency) and industry-specific terms.
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">3. Use Role-Specific and Industry-Specific Terms</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        Employers expect to see industry and role-specific terminology on your resume. Use terms that are commonly used in your profession. For example, if you're applying for a marketing role, use terms like "SEO," "content marketing," and "digital strategy."
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">4. Incorporate Keywords Naturally</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        Avoid keyword stuffing, which can make your resume difficult to read. Instead, incorporate keywords naturally throughout your resume in sections like your work experience, skills, and summary. Aim for balance between readability and keyword optimization.
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">5. Include a Skills Section</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        A dedicated skills section allows you to list the most important keywords related to your abilities. This section should include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (interpersonal strengths), based on the job description.
      </p>

      <h3 className="resume-keywords-heading">6. Optimize for Both ATS and Recruiters</h3>
      <p className="resume-keywords-text">
        While keywords help pass ATS filters, your resume also needs to appeal to human recruiters. Use bullet points, clear formatting, and action verbs to make your resume engaging and easy to read, while still including essential keywords.
      </p>

      <div className="resume-keywords-cta">
        <p className="resume-keywords-summary">
          Using the right keywords is crucial for making sure your resume passes ATS filters and resonates with hiring managers. Tailor your resume to each job application by including relevant keywords that align with the role and industry.
