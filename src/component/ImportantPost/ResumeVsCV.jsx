      <h1 className="resume-vs-cv-title">Resume vs. CV: What You Need to Know</h1>
      <p className="resume-vs-cv-intro">
        When it comes to job applications, two documents are commonly required: a resume and a CV. While they may seem similar, there are key differences you should be aware of.
      </p>

      <div className="resume-vs-cv-section">
        <h2 className="resume-vs-cv-subtitle">What is a Resume?</h2>
        <p className="resume-vs-cv-text">
          A resume is a concise document that highlights your skills, experience, and achievements. Itâ€™s typically tailored to a specific job and is usually no longer than one or two pages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="resume-vs-cv-section">
        <h2 className="resume-vs-cv-subtitle">What is a CV?</h2>
        <p className="resume-vs-cv-text">
          A CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a more detailed document that provides an in-depth overview of your career, including your education, work experience, skills, and accomplishments. It is typically used in academia, research, and international job applications.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="resume-vs-cv-section">
        <h2 className="resume-vs-cv-subtitle">Key Differences</h2>
        <ul className="resume-vs-cv-list">
          <li>Length: Resumes are shorter, while CVs are longer and more detailed.</li>
          <li>Purpose: Resumes are used for most job applications, while CVs are used for academic or international positions.</li>
          <li>Customization: Resumes are tailored for each job, but CVs remain more static over time.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
