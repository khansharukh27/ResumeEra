      <h1 className="xyz-formula-title">XYZ Formula: A Simple Approach to Showcasing Your Achievements in Your Resume</h1>
      <p className="xyz-formula-intro">
        When creating a resume, one challenge many face is how to present their work experience and achievements in a way that stands out.
        Enter the XYZ Formula — a simple yet effective method to highlight your contributions clearly and powerfully.
      </p>
      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">What is the XYZ Formula?</h2>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">
        The XYZ Formula breaks down your accomplishments into three clear parts:
      </p>
      <ul className="xyz-formula-list">
        <li><strong>X:</strong> What you accomplished – the result or achievement.</li>
        <li><strong>Y:</strong> How it was measured – the impact or result you delivered.</li>
        <li><strong>Z:</strong> What you did – the specific actions you took to make it happen.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">Why Does It Matter?</h2>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">
        Employers sift through countless resumes, often with little time to spare. By using the XYZ formula, you give them exactly what they’re looking for in a concise and impactful way:
      </p>
      <ul className="xyz-formula-list">
        <li>Your specific role or contribution (X)</li>
        <li>The quantifiable results (Y)</li>
        <li>The actions you took to achieve those results (Z)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">How to Use It in Your Resume:</h2>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">Instead of just listing your responsibilities, follow this approach for a stronger impact:</p>
      <p className="xyz-example-before"><strong>Before:</strong> “Responsible for managing a team of 10 sales representatives.”</p>
      <p className="xyz-example-after"><strong>After (XYZ Formula):</strong> “Led a team of 10 sales representatives (Z), achieving a 25% increase in quarterly sales (X) by implementing a new customer engagement strategy (Y).”</p>

      <h2 className="xyz-formula-subtitle">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">
        Incorporating the XYZ formula in your resume can make a significant difference in how hiring managers perceive your experience.
        It allows them to quickly see the results of your hard work and the positive impact you could bring to their company.
      </p>
      <p className="xyz-formula-description">
        Start applying the XYZ formula today, and give your resume the boost it needs to impress potential employers!
