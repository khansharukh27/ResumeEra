            In the world of job applications, two terms often create confusion:
            CV (Curriculum Vitae) and Resume. While they are both used to
            present a candidate’s qualifications, there are significant
            differences in their structure, content, and purpose. Understanding
            the difference between CV and resume is crucial for tailoring your
            application to specific job requirements and maximizing your chances
            of success. This comprehensive guide explores all aspects of CVs and
            resumes, helping you distinguish between the two and decide which
            one to use in various scenarios.

          <h2>What is a CV (Curriculum Vitae)?</h2>
          <TechnicalResumeImages techImages={techImages}/>
          <p>
            The term "Curriculum Vitae" originates from Latin, meaning "course
            of life." A CV is a detailed document that outlines an individual’s
            entire academic and professional history. Its primary purpose is to
            provide an in-depth account of achievements, skills, and
            experiences. Knowing the difference between CV and resume helps in
            understanding when to use a CV.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features of a CV</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Length:</strong> A CV is typically longer than a resume,
              often spanning multiple pages. The length depends on the depth of
              your experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content:</strong> It includes detailed sections on

            <li>
              <strong>Format:</strong> CVs are structured chronologically and
              are not tailored to specific job applications. They aim to provide
              a comprehensive overview of a candidate’s career.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common Uses of a CV</h3>

          <p>
            The term "resume" comes from the French word "resumé," meaning
            "summary." A resume is a concise document tailored to highlight
            specific qualifications for a particular job. The difference between
            CV and resume is apparent in the focus and purpose of each document.
          </p>

              experience, skills, and education but omit detailed academic
              accomplishments unless relevant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Format:</strong> Resumes are tailored to specific job
              applications and often use a functional or combination format to
              emphasize relevant skills.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common Uses of a Resume</h3>

            <li>
              Corporate job applications in industries such as IT, finance,
              marketing, and healthcare.
