        <img src="" style={{ width: '100%' }} alt="Tips for React JS Resume" loading="lazy" />
        <p>
          Here are some actionable tips to make your resume stand out:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Use Action Verbs</h4>
        <p>
          Start bullet points with strong action verbs like “developed,” “implemented,” “optimized,” and “collaborated.” These words convey confidence and impact. Enhance this with{' '}
          <Link to="/improving-your-resume-with-action-verbs">Improving Your Resume with Action Verbs</Link>.

        <h4>2. Quantify Achievements</h4>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, use numbers to quantify your accomplishments. For example, instead of saying “improved performance,” say “reduced page load time by 30%.”
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g27SZYSQ/quantifying.png" style={{ width: '100%' }} alt="action verb" loading="lazy" />

        <h4>3. Tailor Your Resume</h4>
        <p>
          Customize your resume for each job application. Carefully read the job description and incorporate relevant keywords, such as <strong>React JS developer resume</strong>, throughout the document.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Optimize for ATS</h4>
        <p>
          Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) screen resumes before they reach hiring managers. To pass ATS filters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use standard fonts (e.g., Arial, Calibri).</li>
          <li>Avoid graphics or tables.</li>
          <li>Incorporate relevant keywords, such as React JS, Redux, and JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h4>5. Proofread Thoroughly</h4>
        <p>
          Spelling and grammatical errors can undermine your credibility. Review your resume multiple times and ask a mentor or peer to proofread it. Avoid pitfalls with{' '}

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid in a React JS Developer Resume</h3>
        <p>
          Avoid these common pitfalls to ensure your resume shines:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Including Irrelevant Information:</strong> Keep your resume focused on React development and related technologies. Avoid listing hobbies or past jobs that don’t align with the role you’re applying for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overloading with Jargon:</strong> While technical terms are essential, make sure your resume remains easy to read for both technical and non-technical reviewers. Strike a balance between showcasing your expertise and ensuring clarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Using Generic Templates:</strong> A generic resume template can make you look just like every other applicant. Opt for a clean, professional layout that reflects your personal style and the specific role you're applying for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neglecting Keywords:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. Without the right industry-specific keywords, your resume could get overlooked. Ensure your resume includes relevant React JS terms like “Redux,” “JSX,” “Hooks,” and “State Management.”
          </li>
        </ol>
