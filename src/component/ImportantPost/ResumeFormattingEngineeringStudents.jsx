            <h2>1. Pick the Right Format</h2>
            <p>
                The way you set up your resume matters. Most students should use the{" "}
                <strong>reverse-chronological format</strong>, which shows your latest
                achievements first. If you’re new to engineering or have unique
                skills, consider other formats. 📄💡👷‍♂️
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reverse-Chronological</strong>: Best for showing work
                    experience or internships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Functional</strong>: Highlights skills over jobs; great for
                    beginners.
                </li>

                Employers only glance at resumes for a few seconds. A clean and simple
                design helps them find what they need. 📋🖊️✅
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Font Choice</strong>: Use fonts like Arial or Calibri in
                    size 10-12 for text and 14-16 for headings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spacing</strong>: Leave some white space for easy reading.
                </li>

            <h2>3. Match It to the Job</h2>
            <p>
                Adjust your resume for each job. Show off skills, experiences, and

                through software that scans for keywords. 🎯📑🛠️
