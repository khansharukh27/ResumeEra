        <h2>What is a Resume, and Why Does it Matter?</h2>
        <p>
          A resume is a document that summarizes your professional background,
          skills, education, and achievements. It serves as a snapshot of your
          qualifications and is designed to convince potential employers to
          invite you for an interview.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is a Resume Important?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>First Impression:</strong> It’s your first interaction with
            the employer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Highlights Your Skills:</strong> Shows what makes you the
            best fit for the role.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Builds Credibility:</strong> Demonstrates professionalism
            and attention to detail.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In today's competitive job market, a generic resume isn’t enough. You
          need a professional, tailored document that aligns with the job
          description.

      <section id="choose-the-right-format">
        <h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Resume Format</h2>
        <p>
          The structure of your resume matters greatly. Choosing the right
          format depends on your career stage, experience level, and the type of
          job you’re applying for. Here are the three most common formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Chronological Resume:</strong> Focuses on work experience in
            reverse chronological order. Best for individuals with a solid work
            history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functional Resume:</strong> Focuses on skills and abilities
            rather than job history. Ideal for career changers or those with
            employment gaps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combination Resume:</strong> Merges the best features of
            chronological and functional formats. Perfect for experienced
            professionals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're unsure which format to use, the
          chronological resume is the safest option, as it’s the most widely
          accepted.
        </p>

      <section id="write-a-strong-header">
        <h2>Step 2: Write a Strong Resume Header</h2>
        <p>
          Your resume header contains essential contact information. It should
          be clear, professional, and easy to read.
        </p>
        <h3>What to Include in the Header:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Your Full Name:</strong> Use a larger font size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phone Number:</strong> Provide a direct, active phone
            number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Email Address:</strong> Avoid informal
            addresses like <em>coolguy123@gmail.com</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LinkedIn Profile or Portfolio Link:</strong> Include links
            to showcase your work or professional profile.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Mention your city and state unless
            applying internationally.
          </li>
