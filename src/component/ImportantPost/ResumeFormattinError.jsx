                                    <h2>Using Unreadable Fonts</h2>
                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Many candidates choose overly fancy or decorative fonts that make their resumes hard to read.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Recruiters spend an average of six seconds reviewing a resume. If your font is difficult to read, they might skip it altogether.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Stick to professional, sans-serif fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica. Ensure the font size is between 10-12 points for the main text and 14-16 points for headings.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Including excessive visuals like charts, icons, and pictures.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Most Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) cannot read graphics and may discard your resume.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Focus on text-based information. If visuals are necessary, provide additional text explanations. Save your resume in an ATS-friendly format like .docx or .pdf.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Filling every inch of the page with text.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> A cramped resume is overwhelming and discourages recruiters from reading further.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Use one-inch margins on all sides. Add line spacing of at least 1.15 for better readability.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Using multiple font styles, sizes, and inconsistent alignment.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Inconsistent formatting looks unprofessional and distracts from the content.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Use a single font throughout the resume. Align all text to the left for uniformity. Create a consistent style for headings, bullet points, and spacing.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Failing to divide your resume into clear sections.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Without headers, recruiters struggle to identify important details quickly.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Include clear headers like “Experience,” “Education,” and “Skills.” Use bold or slightly larger fonts for section titles to make them stand out.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Including lengthy paragraphs instead of concise bullet points.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Recruiters won’t take the time to read through dense text blocks.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Use bullet points to list achievements and responsibilities. Keep each bullet point under two lines. Prioritize quantifiable accomplishments (e.g., “Increased sales by 20%”).</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Writing a resume that’s too long, often over two pages.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Recruiters prefer concise resumes that highlight relevant information.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Limit your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience. Use two pages only if your experience is extensive and highly relevant. Remove outdated or irrelevant jobs to streamline content.</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Relying on old-fashioned templates with heavy borders and elaborate designs.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Such templates can make your resume appear outdated and less professional.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Opt for modern, clean templates that prioritize simplicity. Tools like ResumeEra offer up-to-date, ATS-compatible templates.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> Recruiters need quick access to your email, phone number, and LinkedIn profile.</p>
                                    <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong> Place your contact information at the top of your resume. Double-check for accuracy. Include a professional email address (e.g., [yourname]@gmail.com).</p>

                                    <p><strong>The Error:</strong> Saving your resume with generic or unprofessional filenames like “Resume_Final.docx.”</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why It’s a Problem:</strong> A recruiter might lose track of your resume or view it as unprofessional.</p>
