                                                        <p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong>

                                                                        <li>Ensure the font size is between 10-12 points for the main text and 14-16 points for headings.</li>
                                                                        <li>Avoid using overly stylized fonts like Comic Sans or Courier New, which can come across as unprofessional.</li>
                                                                </ul>

                                                        <p><strong>Expert Advice:</strong> According to resume expert Amanda Augustine, “Recruiters often spend just 6-7 seconds reviewing each resume. If the font is hard to read, they may pass on it without a second thought.”</p>

Including visuals like these might look appealing at first, but they can make your resume look cluttered, and most importantly, Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) will struggle to parse these images, resulting in your resume being discarded.

                                                                        <li>Focus on quantifiable achievements wherever possible (e.g., "Increased sales by 25% in the first quarter").</li>

                                                        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use action verbs and quantify results wherever possible. This gives the recruiter a sense of your impact and contribution in previous roles.</p>
