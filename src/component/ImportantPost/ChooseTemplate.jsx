        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Your resume is often the first impression you make on a potential

        <p>
          The right resume template can make a lasting impression on hiring
          managers. A professional and visually appealing layout helps your
          application stand out, increases readability, and emphasizes your
          qualifications effectively. Conversely, a poorly chosen template can
          distract from your content and leave a negative impression.

          <li>Enhanced presentation of your key skills and experiences.</li>
          <li>Alignment with industry standards and expectations.</li>
          <li>
            Increased chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Understanding {keyword} can make the difference between landing an
          interview and being overlooked. Investing time in this step is
          essential.

      <section className="section-types">
        <h2>Types of Resume Templates</h2>
        <p>
          There are various types of resume templates, each designed to suit
          different industries, career stages, and personal preferences.
          Selecting the right type depends on your professional background and
          the role you are targeting.
        </p>
        <h3>Traditional Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Ideal for conservative industries such as finance, law, and
          government, traditional templates feature a clean, straightforward
          layout. They emphasize text over design elements and prioritize
          clarity and professionalism.
        </p>
        <h3>Creative Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Perfect for creative fields like graphic design, marketing, and media,
          these templates allow for the use of color, unique fonts, and visual
          elements. They showcase your creativity while still maintaining
          professionalism.
        </p>
        <h3>Modern Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Suitable for a wide range of industries, modern templates strike a
          balance between traditional and creative styles. They use subtle
          design elements to enhance readability without overwhelming the
          content.
        </p>
        <h3>Functional Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Best for individuals with less experience or career gaps, functional
          templates focus on skills and achievements rather than chronological
          work history. They highlight transferable skills relevant to the
          desired role.
        </p>

      <section className="section-choosing-tips">
        <h2>How to Choose the Right Resume Template</h2>
        <p>
          Selecting the ideal template requires considering your career goals,
          industry norms, and personal preferences. Use these tips to guide your
          decision:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Understand Your Industry</h3>
        <p>
          Different industries have varying expectations for resume formatting.
          Research the standard practices in your field to ensure your template
          aligns with employer expectations. For example, traditional templates
          work well in conservative fields, while creative templates are better
          for artistic roles.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Reflect Your Career Stage</h3>
        <p>
          Entry-level professionals may benefit from simple, one-page templates,
          while seasoned professionals might require a more detailed layout to
          showcase extensive experience. Functional templates are ideal for
          career changers or those with employment gaps.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Consider ATS Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
          Many companies use ATS to screen resumes. Choose a template with a
          clean layout, standard fonts, and well-structured sections to ensure
          it passes these systems.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Prioritize Readability</h3>
        <p>
          Your resume should be easy to skim. Use bullet points, clear headings,
          and white space to enhance readability and draw attention to key
          information. When you follow {keyword}, your resume achieves optimal
          structure.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Match Your Personal Brand</h3>
        <p>
          Your resume is a reflection of your professional identity. Choose a
          template that aligns with your personal brand and effectively
          communicates your strengths and style.
