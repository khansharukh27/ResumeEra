          <h2>Types of Resume Formats</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing the right resume format is essential for showcasing your skills and experience in a way that grabs the attention of recruiters. Below, we explore the three most common types of resume formats: Chronological, Functional, and Combination. Each format is suited to different types of job seekers and career situations.
          </p>

          <div className="resume-format">
            <h3>1. Chronological Resume Format: Best for Experienced Professionals</h3>
            <p>
              The chronological resume format is one of the most widely recognized formats and is the default choice for many job seekers. It is structured by listing your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job and working backward. This format places a significant focus on your employment history, making it ideal for candidates who have a solid and continuous work history in the same industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why Use It?</strong> If you have a stable work history with no significant gaps in employment, the chronological format will allow you to highlight your career progression and relevant experience. Hiring managers prefer this format because it makes it easy to quickly assess your job history and see how you’ve progressed over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best For:</strong> Professionals with a clear career path, a consistent work history, or those in specialized fields who want to demonstrate their expertise through job experience.

              <ImageCard

                image={image}
                hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

              />
            ))}
            <h3>Pros and Cons of Chronological Format</h3>
            <p>
              The chronological resume format emphasizes your work history, listed in
              reverse chronological order.

                <tr>
                  <td>Familiar to recruiters, making it easy to read and scan.</td>
                  <td>May highlight employment gaps or frequent job changes.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Emphasizes a steady career progression.</td>
                  <td>Less effective for those entering the workforce or changing careers.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Focuses on professional achievements and growth.</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Ideal for showcasing a strong record of employment in a specific industry.</td>
                  <td>Does not highlight skills or experiences unrelated to past jobs.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

          </div>

          <div className="resume-format">
            <h3>2. Functional Resume Format: Best for Career Changers and Freshers</h3>
            <p>
              The functional resume format shifts the focus away from your work history and places it on your skills, achievements, and qualifications. This format is ideal for job seekers who are either new to the workforce (freshers) or looking to change careers. The functional format allows you to highlight transferable skills and achievements without drawing attention to gaps in your employment history.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why Use It?</strong> If you’re transitioning to a new career or entering the job market for the first time, this format allows you to focus on your skills and qualifications rather than work experience. You can show how your skills are relevant to the job, even if they were gained outside of the workforce (e.g., through volunteer work, education, or personal projects).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best For:</strong> Job seekers with limited professional experience, those making a career change, or people with gaps in their employment history.
            </p>

              />
            ))}

          </div>
          <h2>Pros and Cons of Functional Format</h2>
          <p>
            The functional resume format highlights skills and experience over job
            history.
          </p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Highlights specific skills and expertise.</td>
                <td>Can be confusing for employers expecting a traditional format.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Ideal for career changers or those with gaps in employment.</td>
                <td>May raise suspicions about work history gaps.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Allows for a more personalized presentation.</td>
                <td>Not universally accepted across industries.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Focuses on what you can do, not when you did it.</td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <div className="resume-format">
            <h3>3. Combination Resume Format: Best for Skilled Professionals</h3>
            <p>
              The combination resume format combines elements of both the chronological and functional formats. It begins with a skills summary section that highlights your key abilities and qualifications. Following that, you provide a detailed work history section, but the emphasis is on skills and accomplishments. This format allows you to showcase both your career progression and your skill set in a balanced manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why Use It?</strong> If you have a diverse skill set or have worked in different roles and industries, the combination format allows you to present a comprehensive view of your qualifications. This format is particularly useful for individuals seeking managerial roles or those with significant experience in various fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best For:</strong> Professionals with a broad range of skills and work experience, those seeking to emphasize both their abilities and career history, or individuals transitioning to a higher-level position.
            </p>

          <h2>Pros and Cons of Combination Format</h2>
          <p>
            The combination resume format merges aspects of both chronological and
            functional styles.

          <h2>Expert Resume Writing Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Keywords from the Job Description:</strong> Tailor your resume to each job by including keywords and phrases from the job posting. Many companies use ATS software that scans resumes for these keywords, so aligning your resume with the job description is crucial to getting noticed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep It Concise:</strong> Aim for a 1-2 page resume. Focus on the most relevant experience, skills, and achievements. Hiring managers spend only a few seconds reviewing each resume, so you want to make sure your most important information is easy to find.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Highlight Achievements:</strong> Don’t just list your job responsibilities. Focus on what you accomplished in each role. Use specific numbers or metrics when possible to quantify your success (e.g., "Increased sales by 25% in 6 months").
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose a Professional Font:</strong> Stick with simple, professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Avoid ornate or difficult-to-read fonts that could detract from your content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Save Your Resume as a PDF:</strong> Always save your resume as a PDF to preserve its formatting across different devices and software.
