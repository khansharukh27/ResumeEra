          <h2>Why a Well-Structured Resume is Critical</h2>
          <p>
            A resume is more than just a document; it's a personal marketing tool that presents your qualifications, experience, and skills to potential employers. A clear, concise, and professionally formatted resume will help you stand out and demonstrate your professionalism. In today's digital world, hiring managers often screen resumes quickly, so it's essential to have a document that grabs attention immediately.
          </p>
          <TechnicalResumeImages techImages={techImages} />
          <ul>
            <li>First Impressions Matter: Your resume is usually the first point of contact between you and a hiring manager. If it's disorganized or difficult to read, it may be overlooked in favor of another candidate with a cleaner, easier-to-follow document.</li>
            <li>Increases Chances of Getting Noticed: A resume that highlights your strengths and qualifications effectively increases the likelihood that you’ll be invited for an interview.</li>
            <li>Ensures Readability Across Devices: Since resumes are often viewed on different devices, a PDF format guarantees that your resume will look the same regardless of the device or software used by the hiring manager.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By downloading a resume format PDF from trusted sources, you ensure that your resume is professionally designed and formatted to meet industry standards.

          <h2>The Key Types of Resume Formats</h2>
          <p>
            There are several types of resume formats, each catering to different professional needs. Below are the three main types of resume formats you should consider when creating your document:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Chronological Resume Format</strong>
              <div className="template-grid row m-3" style={{width:'100%',height:'auto'}}>
                {[selectedimage].map((image) => (
                  <ImageCard
                    key={image.id}
                    image={image}
                    hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                    setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                    handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

                  />
                ))}
              </div>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Job seekers with a consistent work history in a specific field.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> This format emphasizes work experience, listing jobs in reverse chronological order (most recent job first). Education is typically listed after experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> The chronological resume format is easy to follow and shows clear career progression, which can be impressive to hiring managers.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It may highlight gaps in employment or frequent job changes, which could raise questions with employers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Example of Chronological Resume:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Experience:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Software Engineer | XYZ Corp. | June 2019 – Present</li>
                    <li>Junior Developer | ABC Ltd. | January 2016 – May 2019</li>
                    <li>Intern | DEF Tech. | Summer 2015</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Functional Resume Format</strong>
              {[selectedimage2].map((image) => (
                <ImageCard
                  key={image.id}
                  image={image}
                  hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                  setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                  handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

                />
              ))}
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Candidates changing careers, those with gaps in employment, or applicants with limited work experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> This format focuses on skills and accomplishments rather than a detailed work history. It often highlights transferable skills that are relevant to the job you're applying for.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> It allows job seekers to emphasize their strengths and skills, rather than their job history.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Some employers may find this format harder to read and less familiar than the chronological format.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Example of Functional Resume:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Skills:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Project Management: Managed over 10 cross-functional projects.</li>
                    <li>Communication: Effectively communicated with clients and team members.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Combination (Hybrid) Resume Format</strong>
              {[selectedimage3].map((image) => (
                <ImageCard
                  key={image.id}
                  image={image}
                  hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                  setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                  handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

                />
              ))}
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Professionals with a variety of experiences or those who want to highlight both skills and work history.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> This format combines elements of both chronological and functional formats, with a section for skills at the top and work experience listed in reverse chronological order below.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> The combination format gives you the flexibility to emphasize your skills while showing a clear career history.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It can be more complex to create and may require careful organization to avoid overwhelming the reader.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Example of Combination Resume:</p>
              <ul>

          <h2>How to Choose the Right Resume Format for Your Career</h2>
          <p>
            Selecting the correct resume format is crucial to presenting your qualifications in the best possible light. To help you make the right choice, consider the following factors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Career Stage</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Early Career/Entry-Level: If you are new to the workforce, a functional resume may be ideal as it focuses more on your skills than experience.</li>
                <li>Experienced Professional: For seasoned professionals with a well-established career, the chronological resume format is likely your best bet.</li>
                <li>Career Changers: If you are switching industries or fields, a combination resume allows you to emphasize relevant transferable skills while also showing some work history.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Job Type</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Traditional Roles: For traditional office roles (e.g., administrative assistant, accountant), the chronological format is preferred.</li>
                <li>Creative Jobs: For positions in creative fields (e.g., graphic design, marketing), a combination format or a more visually engaging template could be beneficial.</li>
              </ul>
