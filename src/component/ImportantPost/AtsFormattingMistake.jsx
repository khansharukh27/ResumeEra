  <figcaption>Optimize your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems to avoid ATS formatting mistakes and increase your chances of getting noticed by employers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by many employers to filter and rank resumes. Avoid these common ATS formatting mistakes with tips from <Link to='/20-Resume-Formatting-Mistakes-You-Should-Avoid'>20 Resume Formatting Mistakes You Should Avoid</Link> to ensure your resume gets through the ATS and into the hands of hiring managers. These ATS formatting mistakes could cost you your dream job if you aren’t careful, so it’s crucial to be aware of them.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>1. Using Unreadable Fonts</h2>
<p>One of the most common ATS formatting mistakes is using unreadable fonts. ATS systems are designed to read and parse text in a straightforward manner. When you use complex or decorative fonts, you risk the ATS misinterpreting characters, which could lead to your resume being discarded or ranked lower. Stick to basic, easy-to-read fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri to ensure the ATS can read your content clearly.</p>
<p>Using fancy fonts may seem visually appealing, but it can lead to significant ATS formatting mistakes. The system may not recognize the characters or may not parse the information correctly, causing important details to be overlooked. Prioritize clarity and readability when choosing fonts for your resume to avoid these ATS formatting mistakes.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>2. Including Images or Graphics</h2>
<p>ATS formatting mistake #2: Adding images or graphics to your resume can also hinder its chances of making it through an ATS. While images and graphics can make your resume visually appealing, ATS systems often can't interpret them. This means any important information conveyed through images will be missed, resulting in your qualifications being overlooked.</p>
<p>ATS is programmed to read plain text and is not equipped to understand visual elements such as photos, icons, or logos. Including these could result in your resume being flagged or completely rejected by the system. To avoid ATS formatting mistakes, stick to text-based content and avoid adding any images or non-textual elements to your resume.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>3. Using Headers and Footers</h2>
<p>Placing important information in the header or footer of your resume is another common ATS formatting mistake. Most ATS systems don’t read content in these areas, meaning if your contact information, key skills, or job titles are located in these sections, they may be completely missed by the system.</p>
<p>Ensure that all essential details are in the main body of your resume. By placing your name, contact information, and important experience in the primary sections of your resume, you avoid the risk of having them ignored by ATS due to their location in headers or footers. This simple step can help you avoid a costly ATS formatting mistake.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>4. Using Complex Formatting</h2>
<p>Another ATS formatting mistake is the use of complex formatting, such as tables, text boxes, or columns. ATS software reads resumes linearly, and these formatting choices can confuse the system, potentially leading to crucial information being misinterpreted or omitted. Complex formatting makes it harder for the ATS to parse your resume correctly, which can harm your chances of getting noticed by employers.</p>
<p>Stick to simple formatting that uses clear headings, bullet points, and single-column layouts to avoid these ATS formatting mistakes. A clean, easy-to-read resume will ensure the ATS can accurately interpret your qualifications and experience. Remember, the simpler, the better when it comes to ATS compatibility.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>5. Not Using Keywords</h2>
<p>Failing to use the right keywords in your resume can lead to an ATS formatting mistake that prevents your resume from making it through the ATS screening process. Keywords are critical for ATS systems because they scan resumes for specific terms matching the job description. If your resume lacks these essential keywords, it might be ranked lower or even rejected.</p>
<p>To avoid this ATS formatting mistake, be sure to carefully read the job posting and include relevant keywords throughout your resume. This includes skills, qualifications, and job titles mentioned in the listing. Integrating these keywords will help your resume pass through the ATS filters and increase your chances of getting noticed by hiring managers. See <Link to="/tailor-resume-to-job-description">how to tailor your resume to a job description</Link> for more tips on keyword optimization.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>6. Using Abbreviations</h2>
<p>Another potential ATS formatting mistake is the use of abbreviations. Abbreviations can confuse ATS systems, as they might not recognize the shortened terms or may interpret them incorrectly. For instance, using "B.Sc." instead of "Bachelor of Science" can cause the ATS to misinterpret your credentials.</p>
<p>To avoid this, always spell out abbreviations and acronyms fully. This ensures that the ATS accurately understands your qualifications. For example, instead of "MBA," write "Master of Business Administration." This simple adjustment can prevent an ATS formatting mistake and help ensure that your qualifications are properly recognized by the system.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>7. Not Including Contact Information</h2>
<p>It might seem obvious, but one of the most critical ATS formatting mistakes is not including your contact information clearly. If your name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile aren’t easily accessible, the ATS might miss them, which could lead to your resume being rejected.</p>
<p>Make sure to place your contact information at the very top of your resume, and avoid putting it in headers or footers where the ATS may overlook it. This is a simple yet essential step to avoid an ATS formatting mistake and ensure potential employers can easily reach out to you.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>8. Using Fancy Bullet Points</h2>
<p>Fancy bullet points are another common ATS formatting mistake. While they may look stylish, decorative bullet points might not be recognized by the ATS, which could cause your content to be misinterpreted or skipped over. Stick to standard bullet points like circles or squares to ensure the ATS can read them properly.</p>
<p>Simple and standard bullet points help organize information clearly and ensure that the ATS can parse it correctly. Avoid using icons, arrows, or other creative bullet point styles to avoid any ATS formatting mistakes. Keep your resume clean and straightforward to optimize it for ATS readability.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>9. Not Saving as a .docx or .pdf</h2>
<p>The format in which you save your resume can also lead to ATS formatting mistakes. ATS software typically supports .docx and .pdf file formats, but formats like .jpg or .png are incompatible with ATS and cannot be read. Saving your resume in an unsupported format may result in your resume being skipped entirely.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, always save your resume as a .docx or .pdf file. These formats ensure your resume will be properly parsed and that no information will be lost in the process. This simple step will help you avoid an ATS formatting mistake and make sure your resume reaches the hands of hiring managers.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>10. Using Inconsistent Formatting</h2>
<p>Inconsistent formatting is another ATS formatting mistake that can cause confusion. If your resume contains multiple fonts, sizes, or formatting styles, the ATS may struggle to read and interpret your content correctly. Inconsistent formatting can also make your resume appear unprofessional, which can lead to a lower ranking in the ATS system.</p>
<p>To prevent this ATS formatting mistake, ensure that your formatting is consistent throughout your resume. Use the same font size, style, and spacing throughout the document. A polished and consistent format ensures that the ATS can parse your resume accurately and that your qualifications stand out to employers.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>

<h2>11. Not Testing Your Resume</h2>
<p>Before submitting your resume, it’s crucial to test it for ATS formatting mistakes. Failing to do so can result in your resume being rejected by the ATS system, even if your qualifications are perfect for the job. There are many ATS-friendly tools available that can analyze your resume and provide feedback on its compatibility.</p>
<p>By testing your resume before sending it out, you can identify any formatting issues and make necessary changes. These tools often provide helpful tips on improving your resume’s performance in ATS systems, ensuring that it meets all the necessary requirements and avoids ATS formatting mistakes.</p>
<div><GoogleAd /></div>
