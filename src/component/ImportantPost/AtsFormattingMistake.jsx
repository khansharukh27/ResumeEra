				<p>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by many employers to filter and rank 
					resumes. Avoid these common <Link to='/20-Resume-Formatting-Mistakes-You-Should-Avoid'>Ats formatting mistake</Link> to ensure your resume gets through the ATS and into the hands of hiring managers.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>1. Using Unreadable Fonts</h2>
				<p>Stick to standard fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri to ensure your resume is easily readable by the ATS. Fancy or decorative fonts may not be recognized correctly, leading to important information being missed.</p>
				<p>ATS systems are designed to read and parse text in a straightforward manner. When you use non-standard fonts, the system might misinterpret characters, which can result in your resume being discarded. Always prioritize readability and simplicity in your font choices.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>2. Including Images or Graphics</h2>
				<p>ATS systems often can't read images or graphics, so <Link to='/20-Resume-Formatting-Mistakes-You-Should-Avoid'>avoid</Link> including them in your resume. Stick to text-based content to ensure all your information is captured.</p>
				<p>While images and graphics might make your resume visually appealing, they can be detrimental when it comes to ATS. These systems are not equipped to interpret visual elements, which means any information conveyed through images or graphics will be ignored. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate assessments of your qualifications.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>3. Using Headers and Footers</h2>
				<p>Important information in headers or footers may be missed by the ATS. Keep all critical details in the main body of your resume.</p>
				<p>Headers and footers are often used for aesthetic purposes or to include supplementary information. However, ATS systems typically focus on the main body of the document. Placing essential details like contact information or key skills in headers or footers can result in these details being overlooked. Ensure all vital information is prominently displayed within the main text.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>4. Using Complex Formatting</h2>
				<p>Stick to simple formatting. Avoid tables, text boxes, and columns, as these can confuse the ATS.</p>
				<p>Complex formatting elements like tables, text boxes, and columns can disrupt the ATS's ability to parse your resume correctly. These systems are designed to read text in a linear fashion, and complex layouts can cause misinterpretation or omission of information. Use straightforward formatting with clear headings and bullet points to enhance readability.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>5. Not Using Keywords</h2>
				<p>Include relevant keywords from the job description to ensure your resume is ranked highly by the ATS.</p>
				<p>Keywords play a crucial role in ATS optimization. These systems scan resumes for specific terms that match the job 
					description. Failing to include relevant keywords can result in your resume being ranked lower or 
					even rejected. Carefully review the job posting and incorporate applicable keywords naturally 
					throughout your resume to improve your chances of passing the ATS screening.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>6. Using Abbreviations</h2>
				<p>Spell out abbreviations to ensure the ATS understands them. For example, use "Bachelor of Science" instead of "B.Sc."</p>
				<p>Abbreviations can be ambiguous and may not be recognized by the ATS. To ensure clarity, spell out all abbreviations and acronyms. This practice helps the ATS accurately interpret your qualifications and experiences. For instance, instead of writing "MBA," use "Master of Business Administration."</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>7. Not Including Contact Information</h2>
				<p>Ensure your contact information is included and easily accessible by the ATS.</p>
				<p>Contact information is essential for employers to reach out to you. Make sure your phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable) are prominently displayed at the top of your resume. Avoid placing this information in headers or footers, as it may be missed by the ATS.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>8. Using Fancy Bullet Points</h2>
				<p>Stick to standard bullet points like circles or squares. Fancy bullet points may not be recognized by the ATS.</p>
				<p>Bullet points are an effective way to organize information and make your resume more readable. However, using non-standard or decorative bullet points can cause issues with ATS parsing. Stick to simple, standard bullet points to ensure your content is accurately interpreted.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>9. Not Saving as a .docx or .pdf</h2>
				<p>Save your resume as a .docx or .pdf file, as these formats are typically compatible with ATS systems.</p>
				<p>The file format of your resume can impact its compatibility with ATS. While .docx and .pdf are generally safe choices, avoid using formats like .jpg or .png, which are not text-based and cannot be read by ATS. Ensure your resume is saved in a format that preserves its structure and content.</p>
				<div><GoogleAd /></div>
				<h2>10. Using Inconsistent Formatting</h2>
				<p>Ensure your formatting is consistent throughout your resume. Inconsistent formatting can confuse the ATS.</p>
				<p>Consistency in formatting is key to creating a professional and readable resume. Inconsistent use of fonts, spacing, and alignment can make your resume look disorganized and may confuse the ATS. Maintain uniform formatting throughout your document to enhance readability and ensure accurate parsing.</p>

				<h2>11. Not Testing Your Resume</h2>
				<p>Test your resume with an ATS-friendly tool to ensure it will be read correctly by the system.</p>
				<p>Before submitting your resume, it's a good idea to test it with an ATS-friendly tool or service. These tools can help identify potential issues and provide suggestions for improvement. By testing your resume, you can ensure it meets ATS requirements and increases your chances of getting noticed by employers.</p>
