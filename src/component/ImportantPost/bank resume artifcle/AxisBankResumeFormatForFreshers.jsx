                    <h3>Step 1: Include Your Contact Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        Start with your name, phone number, and email at the top. Use a professional email—like “vikas.mehta@email.com”—not something casual like “axisnewbie123@email.com”. This helps Axis Bank reach you quickly, ready to create, update, and download your resume.

                        <li>vikas.mehta@email.com</li>
