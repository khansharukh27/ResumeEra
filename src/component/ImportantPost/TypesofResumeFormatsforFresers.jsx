When choosing a resume format for freshers, you need to keep in mind your skills, experiences, and the type of job you're applying for.

                    <h2>Top Resume Formats for Freshers</h2>
                    <p>When you're just starting out in your career, there are three primary types of resume formats you can use. Let’s break down each format and explore when it’s best to use.</p>

                    <h3>1. Chronological Resume Format</h3>
                    <p>
                        The chronological resume format is one of the most commonly used formats for job seekers with a consistent work history. In this format, your work experience is listed in reverse chronological order, meaning your most recent job is listed first.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Candidates with some relevant internship or work experience.</li>
                        <li>Those who have progressed in a specific career field.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact Information</li>
                        <li>Objective or Summary (Optional)</li>
                        <li>Education</li>
                        <li>Work Experience (most recent job listed first)</li>
                        <li>Skills and Certifications</li>
                        <li>Hobbies (optional)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simple and easy to follow.</li>
                        <li>Shows career progression clearly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not ideal for freshers with little to no work experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    {[selectedimage].map((image) => (
                        <ImageCard
                            key={image.id}
                            image={image}
                            hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                            setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                            handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

                        />
                    ))}

                    <h3>2. Functional Resume Format</h3>
                    <p>
                        The functional resume format focuses on skills and abilities rather than work experience. This format allows freshers to highlight their relevant skills, educational background, and certifications in a way that draws attention to their strengths.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freshers who have limited or no work experience.</li>
                        <li>Those looking to shift careers or highlight transferable skills.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Key Sections:</strong></p>

                        <li>Objective or Summary</li>
                        <li>Skills (organized by category)</li>
                        <li>Education</li>
                        <li>Certifications</li>
                        <li>Volunteer Work or Internships (if applicable)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focuses on skills rather than work experience.</li>
                        <li>Perfect for freshers with minimal experience.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can be seen as an attempt to hide a lack of experience.</li>
                        <li>Employers may feel that this format lacks transparency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    {[selectedimage2].map((image) => (
                        <ImageCard
                            key={image.id}

                    ))}
                    <h3>3. Combination Resume Format</h3>
                    <p>
                        The combination resume format combines the best features of both the chronological and functional formats. This format allows you to emphasize your skills and qualifications while still showing your work experience in reverse chronological order.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freshers with a mix of relevant skills and limited experience.</li>
                        <li>Those who have completed internships, projects, or volunteer work.</li>
