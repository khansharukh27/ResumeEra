      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> It allows you to connect personally with the hiring manager by explaining why you’re interested in the position and what excites you about the company.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlighting Skills:</strong> You can highlight key skills and experiences that directly relate to the job, making it easier for hiring managers to see your fit for the role.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting the Tone:</strong> A cover letter can set a positive tone for your application, showcasing your enthusiasm and professionalism.</li>
      </ul>
