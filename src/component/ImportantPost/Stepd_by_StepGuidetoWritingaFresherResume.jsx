                <h2>2. Key Components of a Fresher Resume Template</h2>
                <p>
                    To create a resume format that works well for a fresher, here are the key sections that should be included in your document:
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                <p>This is the first section of your resume and should include your name, contact information, and location. Keep it simple and professional.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        • Name: John Doe <br />
                        • Phone: 123-456-7890<br />
                        • Email: john.doe@email.com<br />
                        • LinkedIn (Optional): linkedin.com/in/johndoe<br />
                        • Location: New York, NY <br />
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Objective Statement</h3>
                <p>The objective statement at the start of your resume
                    is crucial as it briefly explains who you are and what
                    you aim to achieve in your career. For freshers, this is
                    your chance to show enthusiasm, eagerness to learn, and a
                    desire to contribute to the organization.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        "A highly motivated and results-driven recent <br />
                        graduate in Computer Science seeking a challenging role as a <br />
                        software developer. Eager to apply programming skills and problem-solving <br />
                        abilities to contribute to innovative technology solutions in a dynamic work environment."<br />
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Education Section</h3>
                <p>
                    Since work experience might be limited, the education section will be one of the most critical aspects of your resume. Be sure to list your degree, the name of the institution, and your graduation date. If your GPA is high (above 3.5), consider including that as well.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        • Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science <br />
                        • XYZ University, New York<br />
                        • Graduated: 2024<br />
                        • CGPA: 8.5/10<br />
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    Highlighting your skills is essential, especially for freshers, as it showcases your qualifications and what you bring to the table. Divide them into two categories: technical (hard) skills and soft skills.
                </p>

                <h4>Technical Skills:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming Languages: Java, Python, SQL</li>
                    <li>Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Tools: Git, VS Code, Eclipse</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Soft Skills:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Problem-solving</li>
                    <li>Time management</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Projects and Internships</h3>
                <p>
                    Freshers often lack professional work experience, but they can make up for it with relevant projects and internships. Be sure to list any academic projects, personal projects, or internships you've completed that showcase your skills and abilities.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        • Project: E-Commerce Website <br />

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Certifications and Achievements</h3>
                <p>If you've earned any relevant certifications or have received notable achievements, make sure to include them. This can set you apart from other candidates.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        • Certified in Java Programming (Oracle, 2024)<br />

                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <p>If applicable, you can include a section for extracurricular activities, languages spoken, or volunteer work.</p>

                    <li>Functional Resume Format: Focuses more on your skills and qualifications rather than your work history. This format works best for freshers who lack professional experience but want to highlight their skills and education.</li>

                        <ImageCard

                    <li>Combination Resume Format: Combines elements of both the chronological and functional formats. It focuses on both skills and work history (or relevant projects/internships), making it suitable for freshers with some experience but not much formal work history.</li>
                    {[selectedimage5].map((image) => (
                        <ImageCard

                            hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                            setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                            handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

                <p>
                    For freshers, the functional resume format is often the best choice because it allows you to focus on your strengths and educational background, rather than on professional experience.

                    <h2>6. ATS Optimization: Making Your Resume ATS-Friendly</h2>

                    <p>In today’s competitive job market, many companies use <strong>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</strong> to screen resumes before they even reach the hiring manager. To increase your chances of getting noticed, it’s crucial to make your resume ATS-friendly. Here's a more detailed guide on how to optimize your resume for ATS:</p>

                    <h3>1. <strong>Use Relevant Keywords</strong></h3>
                    <p>ATS software scans your resume for specific keywords that align with the job description. These keywords often include skills, tools, certifications, and even job titles. For example, if the job description mentions skills like “project management,” “JavaScript,” or “customer support,” make sure those terms appear in your resume (assuming you have them). Incorporate keywords naturally into your work experience and skills sections to increase the likelihood that the ATS will flag your resume as a match.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you’re unsure what keywords to include, closely examine the job description for recurring terms or phrases and prioritize those.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the job description mentions "data analysis" and "SQL," you should incorporate these keywords in your resume, such as in the "Skills" section: "Proficient in Data Analysis and SQL." This increases the chances of the ATS recognizing your resume as relevant.</p>

                    <h3>2. <strong>Simple Formatting</strong></h3>
                    <p>ATS systems struggle with complex formatting. To ensure your resume is easily parsed by ATS, keep it simple and clean. Avoid using tables, columns, text boxes, and images, as these may confuse the software and lead to important information being missed or misinterpreted.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Font:</strong> Stick with standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.</li>
                        <li><strong>Headings:</strong> Use clear and standard headings (e.g., "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills") for each section of your resume.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong> Use simple bullet points to list your achievements or responsibilities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A simple, clean structure might look like this:
                        <pre>Work Experience
                            Marketing Manager | XYZ Company | January 2020 – Present
                            - Managed social media campaigns across multiple platforms
                            - Increased engagement by 25% year-over-year</pre>
                        This format is easy for ATS to read and understand, as opposed to using text boxes or complex layouts.</p>

                    <h3>3. <strong>Include Job Titles and Skills</strong></h3>
                    <p>Using the right job titles and skill sets is essential for ATS optimization. Some job titles can be unique to a company, so try to use more standard or commonly recognized titles that ATS might be programmed to identify.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If your job title was “Marketing Ninja,” an ATS might not recognize that as a common marketing role. Instead, you can use a more standard job title such as “Marketing Specialist” or “Digital Marketing Manager.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Skills Section:</strong> A dedicated skills section, where you list relevant skills (both technical and soft skills), can help ATS systems pick up on key competencies. This section should mirror the skills mentioned in the job description.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the job description lists "JavaScript" and "HTML," ensure these skills are included in your "Skills" section, like this:
                        <pre>Skills: <br />
                            - JavaScript<br />
                            - HTML5<br />
                            - ReactJS</pre>
                        This helps the ATS match your qualifications to the job description.</p>

                    <h3>4. <strong>Avoid Fancy Templates</strong></h3>
                    <p>While visually appealing resumes may look good to human eyes, ATS systems may have difficulty parsing creative designs or non-standard templates. Stick to a clean, professional layout that’s easy for the ATS to understand and scan.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Avoid using fancy templates with intricate designs or graphics. Instead, choose a simple layout that focuses on clarity. For instance, use clear headings and bullet points like in the following structure:</p>
                    <pre>Work Experience
                        Job Title | Company Name | Date
                        - Key Responsibility or Achievement</pre>

                    <p>This ensures that the ATS can properly parse the information, and it also looks neat and professional for human readers.</p>

                    <p>By following these tips, you’ll improve the chances that your resume will get past ATS filters and into the hands of a hiring manager.</p>
