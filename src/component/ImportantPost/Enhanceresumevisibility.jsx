        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
          Getting your resume noticed by hiring managers can often feel like an uphill battle. With hiring systems
          becoming increasingly automated, it’s more important than ever to create a resume that stands out.
          Did you know that most resumes have only a 5% chance of being read? This low percentage is partly due to
          Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which are designed to filter out resumes that don’t match the right
          keywords or formatting.
          If you want to improve your chances of securing an interview, it’s crucial to enhance your resume visibility.
          A well-optimized resume will not only catch the attention of hiring managers but also pass through ATS filters
          seamlessly. Here, we’ll discuss 11 essential resume guidelines and sections that can significantly boost your
          resume’s effectiveness. From keyword optimization to including specific technologies, each of these strategies
          will help you land more interviews. {/* Interlinking to a related ATS article */}

        <h2>Guidelines to Enhance Resume Visibility</h2>

        {/* Guideline 1 */}
        <h3>1. Incorporate the Right Keywords and Technologies</h3>
        <section>
          To enhance your resume visibility, the first step is to focus on the keywords related to the job you’re
          applying for. Hiring managers use ATS to scan resumes, so if your resume doesn’t match the job description’s
          keywords, it won’t even get read. It’s essential to identify the core "buzzwords" or technical terms associated
          with the job and industry. These terms typically include job titles, technologies, software, methodologies,
          and other role-specific skills.
        </section>
        <section>How to incorporate keywords:</section>
        <ul style={{ padding: 0, listStyle: "none" }}>
          <li>
            Study the job description: Carefully go through the job listing and pick out important keywords, such as
            specific tools or programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use synonyms and variations: ATS may scan for different variations of the same word, so don’t hesitate to
            use synonyms. For instance, if the job description asks for “project management experience,” you could
            include variations like “project coordination” or “project lead.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: If you’re applying for a software development role, keywords like "Java," "Python," "Agile," and
            "DevOps" should appear prominently in your resume if you have experience with them. {/* Interlinking */}

          In today’s competitive job market, continuous learning is crucial. Demonstrating that you are investing in

          your commitment to personal and professional growth.

            requirements.
