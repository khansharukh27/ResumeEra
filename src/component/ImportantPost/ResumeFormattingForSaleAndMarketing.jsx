            <h2>Choosing a Professional Layout</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            The first step in creating the best resume formatting for sales and
            marketing professionals is selecting a professional layout. The
            layout should be clean, modern, and easy to read. Here are some key
            tips:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Fonts:</strong> Use fonts like Arial,
              Calibri, or Helvetica for a clean and approachable look.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consistent Font Sizes:</strong> Maintain consistent font
              sizes, using 10–12 points for text and 14–16 points for headings
              to enhance clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>White Space:</strong> Incorporate ample white space
              between sections and bullet points to improve visual appeal and
              readability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Page Limit:</strong> Avoid clutter by limiting your resume
              to 1-2 pages while emphasizing the most relevant details.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Choosing the right layout ensures that your resume is visually
            appealing and easy to navigate, which is essential for making a
            strong first impression.

            <h2>Strong Contact Section</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            A strong contact section is a vital component of the best resume
            formatting for sales and marketing professionals. This section
            should include your full name, phone number, email address, LinkedIn
            profile link, and any personal portfolio or website links. Make sure
            this section is prominently placed at the top of the document for
            quick visibility.

            <h2>Crafting a Compelling Professional Summary</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            The professional summary is a crucial element in the best resume
            formatting for sales and marketing professionals. In 3-4 concise
            sentences, highlight your expertise, key achievements, and unique
            qualifications. This is your opportunity to grab the recruiter's
            attention right away.
          </p>

              relationships, and leading impactful marketing campaigns. Skilled

            you’re applying for, emphasizing your most relevant skills and
            accomplishments.

            The work experience section is where you can showcase your
            accomplishments and the impact you’ve had in previous roles. Focus
            on measurable achievements rather than just listing job
            responsibilities. Use bullet points and action verbs to articulate
            your impact. Quantify results whenever possible to provide context
            for your achievements.

          </header>

          <p>
            Most companies use ATS software to screen resumes before they reach
            hiring managers. To ensure your resume is ATS-friendly, follow these
            guidelines:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Standard Section Headings: Use standard section headings such as
              “Work Experience,” “Skills,” and “Education.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Relevant Keywords: Incorporate job-specific keywords naturally
              throughout the resume.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple Formatting: Avoid excessive use of graphics, tables, or
              unconventional fonts that might confuse the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              File Format: Save and submit your resume in ATS-compatible formats
              like PDF or Word.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Optimizing your resume for ATS ensures that it reaches the hands of
            recruiters and hiring managers.
