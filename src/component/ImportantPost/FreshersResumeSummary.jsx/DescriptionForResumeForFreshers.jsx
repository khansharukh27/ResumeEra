                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Key strengths like “proficient in Python” or “effective communicator.”</li>

                        A description for resume for freshers is short but powerful. It’s not a autobiography—it’s a hook to grab attention.
