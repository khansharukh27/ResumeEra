      <h1 className="remote-jobs-title">Resume Writing Tips for Remote Jobs</h1>
      <p className="remote-jobs-intro">
        Applying for remote jobs requires a slightly different approach to resume writing. Here are some tips to help you tailor your resume for remote positions and stand out as a top candidate.
      </p>

      <div className="remote-jobs-section">
        <h2 className="remote-jobs-subtitle">1. Highlight Remote Work Experience</h2>
        <p className="remote-jobs-text">
          If you have previous experience working remotely, make sure to highlight it. Mention the tools you’ve used (e.g., Slack, Zoom, Trello) and emphasize your ability to work independently.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="remote-jobs-section">
        <h2 className="remote-jobs-subtitle">2. Showcase Self-Motivation and Time Management</h2>
        <p className="remote-jobs-text">
          Working remotely requires excellent time management and the ability to stay motivated without direct supervision. Highlight these skills and provide examples of how you’ve successfully managed remote projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="remote-jobs-section">
        <h2 className="remote-jobs-subtitle">3. Emphasize Communication Skills</h2>
        <p className="remote-jobs-text">
          Communication is key in remote work environments. Highlight your proficiency with both written and verbal communication, as well as any experience using collaboration tools.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="remote-jobs-section">
        <h2 className="remote-jobs-subtitle">4. Tailor Your Resume to the Remote Job</h2>
        <p className="remote-jobs-text">
          Customize your resume to the specific remote job you’re applying for. Look for keywords in the job description and use them in your resume to demonstrate that you’re a perfect fit for the role.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="remote-jobs-section">
        <h2 className="remote-jobs-subtitle">5. Demonstrate Tech Proficiency</h2>
        <p className="remote-jobs-text">
          Remote jobs often require a high level of tech proficiency. Make sure to include any relevant technical skills, software expertise, and remote collaboration tools you’re familiar with.
