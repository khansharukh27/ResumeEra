                        This is the first thing recruiters will see, so make sure your contact details are clear and up-to-date. Include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full Name</li>

                    <h3>üéØ 2. Objective or Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        While this section is optional, an objective or summary can give your resume a personal touch. As a fresher, this is an opportunity to express your career aspirations, highlight key skills, and show what you can contribute to the company. Keep it short and focused.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Since freshers typically don‚Äôt have extensive work experience, the skills section is one of the most important parts of your resume. List skills that are relevant to the job you're applying for, including:

                    <ul>
