                    Are you just starting out and looking for your first job or internship? Your resume needs to do more than look good‚Äîit has to pass through something called an <strong>Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</strong>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many companies use ATS software to filter resumes. If your resume isn‚Äôt <Link to='/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-ATS-in-2024'>Ats-friendly</Link>, 
                    it might never even get seen by a person. 
                    But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis guide will show you exactly how to make a resume that 
                    stands out <em>and</em> gets through ATS software, ensuring you have the best 
                    chance at landing an interview.

                <h2>What is an ATS? And Why Does It Matter? ü§î</h2>
                <p>
                    An ATS is a program that looks for specific keywords, formatting, and structure in resumes to decide if you're a good fit for the job. If your resume doesn‚Äôt meet its standards, it won‚Äôt reach the recruiter. ATS software is commonly used by companies to save time during the hiring process, especially when they receive hundreds of applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of it as a video game level: your resume has to beat the ATS before it reaches the next stage where a human recruiter reviews it. Knowing how to make your resume ATS-friendly gives you a major advantage.

                <h2>Easy Steps to Make an ATS-Friendly Resume üìÑ</h2>
                <h3>1. Pick a Simple Format</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a clean, easy-to-read style with clear section headings.</li>
                    <li>Organize your information in reverse-chronological order, starting 
                        with your most recent education or experience.</li>
                    <li><Link to="/11-ats-formatting-mistakes-that-can-cost-you-a-job">Avoid</Link> overly creative designs. While they may look appealing, 
                        ATS systems often can‚Äôt process them correctly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Use Common Fonts ‚úçÔ∏è</h3>
                <p>Stick to fonts that are standard and easy to read, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arial</li>
                    <li>Times New Roman</li>
                    <li>Calibri</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><Link to='/11-ats-formatting-mistakes-that-can-cost-you-a-job'>Avoid</Link></strong> Decorative fonts, pictures, or unconventional layouts. These might confuse the ATS and lead to your resume being rejected.</p>
                <h3>3. Add the Right Keywords üîë</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study the job posting carefully to find important keywords, such as "teamwork," "coding," "leadership," or "problem-solving."</li>
                    <li>Include these keywords naturally in your resume, especially in the skills and experience sections.</li>
                    <li>Remember, <Link to='/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-ATS-in-2024'>Ats-system</Link> use these keywords to determine if you match the job requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Save in the Right Format üóÇ</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save your resume as a <strong>PDF</strong> or <strong>Word Document (DOCX)</strong>‚Äîthese formats are widely supported by ATS software.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using uncommon file types or saving your resume as an image (like JPG or PNG), as these formats may not be readable.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr />
                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Your Resume üìã</h2>
                <h3>Step 1: Add a Header</h3>
                <p>Your header is at the very top of your resume. Make sure it includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your full name (avoid nicknames).</li>
                    <li>A reliable phone number.</li>
                    <li>A professional email address (don‚Äôt use playful or informal emails like <em>coolkid123@gmail.com</em>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Taylor Smith</strong><br />üìû 123-456-7890<br />üìß taylor.smith@email.com</p>
                <p>If you have a LinkedIn profile or a personal portfolio website, you can also include those links. Just make sure the information on them is up-to-date and professional.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Write a Simple Summary üåü</h3>
                <p>Your summary is a short introduction about you. It explains who you are, what skills you have, and what kind of opportunity you‚Äôre looking for.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p><em>"Hardworking high school graduate with strong communication and organizational skills. Excited to bring enthusiasm and a strong work ethic to an entry-level role."</em></p>
                <p>For a fresher, this section is a great way to make a positive impression right away.</p>
                <h3>Step 3: List Your Education üéì</h3>
                <p>Even if you don‚Äôt have work experience, your education is one of your strongest assets. Include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of your school.</li>
                    <li>Your expected graduation date.</li>
                    <li>Your GPA, but only if it‚Äôs above 3.0.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Springfield High School</strong><br />Expected Graduation: June 2025<br />GPA: 3.8/4.0</p>
                <p>If you‚Äôve taken any advanced courses or participated in school programs like AP classes, mention them here as well.</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Show Your Skills üõ†Ô∏è</h3>
                <p>Your skills section should highlight abilities that are relevant to the job. Think about technical skills (like software knowledge) and soft skills (like teamwork or leadership).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.</li>
                    <li>Strong teamwork and communication abilities.</li>
                    <li>Beginner-level coding in Python.</li>
                    <li>Skilled in time management and problem-solving.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Grouping your skills into categories, such as "Technical Skills" and "Soft Skills," can make them even easier to read.</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Add Any Experience or Projects ü§ùüèº</h3>
                <p>If you don‚Äôt have formal work experience, focus on projects, internships, or volunteer work. These can showcase your initiative and dedication.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Volunteer Work: Food Bank Helper</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helped organize and distribute food donations for families in need.</li>
                    <li>Improved inventory management to speed up distribution times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>School Project: Science Fair Winner</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed and built a working wind turbine for renewable energy.</li>
                    <li>Presented findings to a panel and received first place.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Including accomplishments like these can set you apart from other candidates.</p>
