          <h2>1. Why a Resume Matters for Freshers üìÑ</h2>
          <p>
            A resume is often your first chance to make a strong impression on
            employers. As a fresher, you may not have much work experience, but
            your resume still serves as a powerful tool to showcase your
            education, skills, and any relevant projects or internships you‚Äôve
            completed. A well-structured resume can help you stand out among
            other candidates and land interviews.

          <h2>2. Essential Sections of a Fresher Resume üìù</h2>
          <p>

            your qualifications and strengths. Here‚Äôs an overview of the key
            sections to include:
          </p>

          <h3>Contact Information üìû</h3>
          <p>
            This is the most basic section but also one of the most important.
            Make sure you include:
          </p>
          <ul>

          </pre>

          <h3>Career Objective üéØ</h3>

            it to the job you're applying for.
          </p>
