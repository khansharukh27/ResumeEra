                <h2>What Is Resume Formatting and Why Is It Important?</h2>
                <p>Resume formatting refers to organizing and structuring your resume in a way that is clear, concise, and visually appealing. A well-formatted resume ensures that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key information is highlighted:</strong> Recruiters can quickly identify your skills, experience, and achievements. ✅</li>
                    <li><strong>It passes ATS screening:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes, and proper formatting increases your chances of getting through. 📋</li>
                    <li><strong>It reflects professionalism:</strong> A neat and clean layout conveys your attention to detail and professionalism. 🌟</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Moreover, as job markets grow more competitive, having a formatted resume tailored to specific industries or roles can give you a significant advantage. Many job seekers fail to realize that poor formatting can result in missed opportunities, even if they have strong qualifications. 🎯🖋️📈</p>
