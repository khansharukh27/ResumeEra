          <h2>What is a Resume Format PDF? 📄</h2>
          <p>A resume format PDF refers to a resume that’s created in a specific layout and saved as a PDF file. The PDF format is widely accepted because it preserves the design and structure of your resume no matter what device or program someone uses to open it 📱💻.</p>
          <p>Unlike Word documents, PDFs cannot be easily edited, ensuring that your resume appears exactly as you intended 🛡️. It’s a safe, professional, and easy-to-share format that hiring managers and recruiters prefer 👔.</p>
          <p>But why is choosing the right resume format important? 🤔 Your resume format impacts how easily your qualifications are read and understood by recruiters. The goal is to present your skills, work history, and achievements in a clear and attractive way that will make you stand out from other candidates 🌟.</p>

          <h2>Why Should You Choose a Resume Format PDF? 🤔</h2>
          {[selectedimage].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
          <p>There are several advantages to using a resume format PDF 📄:</p>
          <h3>1. Professional Appearance 👔</h3>
          <p>A resume in PDF format looks professional and maintains its formatting across all devices. Whether someone opens your resume on a computer, tablet, or phone, it will look just as you intended 📱💻.</p>
          <h3>2. Easy to Share 📤</h3>
          <p>Most employers and job application portals prefer receiving resumes in PDF format because it's easy to download, view, and store 📥. It’s also much safer to send a PDF via email without worrying about the file getting corrupted or altered 🛡️.</p>

          <h3>3. No Formatting Issues 🛠️</h3>
          <p>Unlike Word documents, PDFs don’t suffer from formatting issues when opened on different devices. What you design in a resume format PDF will remain intact, ensuring your resume always looks neat and clean ✨.</p>

          <h3>4. Security 🔒</h3>
          <p>Once you save your resume as a PDF, it’s locked in place and cannot be easily altered. This ensures that your resume won’t be accidentally changed or tampered with by someone else 🛡️.</p>

          <h2 >According To Expert</h2>
          <p>According to experts, when formatting a resume as a PDF, the key is to keep it clean, 
            concise, and ATS-friendly by using a standard font like Arial or Calibri, appropriate margins, 
            consistent formatting, and avoiding fancy layouts or graphics that might disrupt Applicant 
            Tracking Systems (ATS) scans; always 
            save your resume as a PDF to ensure the layout remains consistent across different devices and platforms. </p>
