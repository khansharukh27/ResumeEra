            <h3>5. Why should I use a PDF format for my resume?</h3>
            <p>
              A PDF format ensures your resume’s formatting stays consistent across devices, making it look professional to hiring managers. Unlike Word documents, PDFs can’t be easily edited, which protects your content. Learn more about the benefits in <Link to="/pdf-vs-word-resume">PDF vs Word Resume</Link> and why it’s a preferred choice for job applications.
