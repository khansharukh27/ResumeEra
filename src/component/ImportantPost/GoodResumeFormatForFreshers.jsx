                    <h2>Why a Good Resume Format for Fresher Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        A good resume format is crucial for several reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>First Impressions Matter</strong><br />
                            Hiring managers spend only a few seconds on each resume. A well-organized resume makes you stand out, showing you’re professional and detail-oriented. The right format can make all the difference in catching the employer's eye and securing an interview.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Shows Professionalism</strong><br />
                            A clean, well-structured resume reflects professionalism and your ability to present yourself effectively. A polished format conveys that you are serious about the job and understand the importance of clarity and organization.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Easy to Read</strong><br />
                            An easy-to-read format ensures that your qualifications and skills are immediately clear to hiring managers. By organizing information with clear headings, bullet points, and concise sections, you make it easier for employers to see why you're a strong candidate, even with limited experience.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                </div>

                <h2>Choosing the Right Resume Format for Fresher</h2>
                <p>When it comes to creating a resume for fresher positions, there are several formats you can choose from. Here are the most common types:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Resume Format</th>

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Chronological</td>
                            <td>Individuals with some work experience</td>
                            <td>Lists your work history in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent job.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Functional</td>
                            <td>Individuals with little or no work experience</td>
                            <td>Focuses on your skills and qualifications, rather than your work history.</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Combination</td>
                            <td>Individuals with both skills and work experience</td>
                            <td>Combines the benefits of both chronological and functional formats, emphasizing skills while also showcasing your work history.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <section>
                    <h2>How to Choose the Right Resume Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        Choosing the right resume format is critical because it helps you present your qualifications in a clear and organized way, showcasing your strengths based on the type and amount of experience you have. Here’s a breakdown of three popular resume formats and when to choose each one:
                    </p>

                    <h3>• Chronological Format:</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the most traditional and widely-used resume format. If you have some relevant work experience, whether through internships, part-time jobs, or volunteer work, this format is ideal for you. The chronological format lists your work history in reverse order, starting with your most recent role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This format is especially beneficial for those who:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have held internships or part-time positions that are related to the job you're applying for.</li>
                        <li>Want to highlight career growth and progression over time.</li>
                        <li>Have built a track record of accomplishments and responsibility in a professional setting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    {[selectedimage].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
                    <p>
                        By using this format, potential employers can quickly assess your work history and see how your experience aligns with the role. However, as a fresher, if you don’t have relevant work experience, you may want to choose another format.
                    </p>

                    <h3>• Functional Format:</h3>
                    <p>
                        For freshers who have limited or no formal work experience, the functional resume format is an excellent choice. This format emphasizes your skills and competencies rather than your work history. By focusing on what you can do, you can draw attention to your key abilities that are valuable in the workplace, such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and technical expertise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The functional format is ideal for candidates who:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are just entering the workforce or are transitioning into a new field.</li>
                        <li>Have academic projects, internships, or volunteer work to show, but not enough professional work experience to list in a chronological format.</li>
                        <li>Want to demonstrate their skills upfront without the need to emphasize a lack of experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    {[selectedimage2].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
                    <p>
                        This format helps to highlight transferable skills and qualifications that are applicable to the job, even if you don’t have extensive work experience. However, some employers may be skeptical of this format if they prefer to see a clear, chronological career progression.
                    </p>

                    <h3>• Combination Format:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The combination resume format merges the best of both the chronological and functional formats, making it ideal for those who want to highlight both their skills and work experience. This format allows you to focus on relevant skills at the top, followed by a concise work history section that showcases key roles or internships you've held.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The combination format is particularly useful for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Candidates with some work experience, perhaps gained through internships, freelance jobs, or volunteer work, but still lacking a full-time professional career.</li>
                        <li>Freshers who have built a range of skills through academic projects, part-time jobs, or personal initiatives.</li>
                        <li>Job seekers who want to demonstrate how their skills directly contributed to their past roles and projects, while also showing their career trajectory.</li>
                    </ul>
                    {[selectedimage5].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
                    <p>
                        By using the combination format, you can effectively communicate both your practical experience and your technical or soft skills, making it a great option for freshers who have a blend of both.

                <h2>Creating a Good Resume Format for Fresher</h2>

                <h3>1. Contact Information</h3>

Include your full name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable). A professional email address is essential—avoid using informal or unprofessional email addresses.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        Example:

                <p>
                    For freshers, a career objective is a key section to include on your resume. It offers you an opportunity to express your career goals and highlight why you're a strong fit for the role. Keep it concise—ideally 2-3 lines—and tailor it to the job you're applying for, demonstrating how your skills and ambitions align with the employer’s needs.
