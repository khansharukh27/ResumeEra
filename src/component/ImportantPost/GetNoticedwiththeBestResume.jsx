        <h2>Why PDF is the Best Resume Format</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to submitting your resume, the resume format PDF is hands down the best choice. Here are a few reasons why PDFs are the ideal format for resumes in 2025:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Formatting Issues</strong>: Unlike Word documents or Google Docs, PDFs preserve your formatting exactly as you intended. This means no unexpected font changes, margin issues, or misaligned sections. Whether the hiring manager opens it on a computer, tablet, or phone, your resume will look the same.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Appearance</strong>: PDF files are the gold standard for professional document submissions. Submitting your resume as a PDF shows employers that you’re serious about your application and that you’ve taken the time to ensure your resume is polished.</li>
          <li><strong>Security</strong>: PDFs are less likely to be accidentally edited, making them a more secure option than Word files. This ensures that your resume stays exactly how you created it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always save your resume as a PDF before submitting it. Not only will it look more professional, but it also eliminates the risk of formatting issues.</p>

              <td>Classic Resume Template</td>
              <td>Entry-level candidates or professionals with experience</td>
              <td>Simple layout with sections for education, experience, and skills.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Creative Resume Template</td>
              <td>Designers, artists, and creative professionals</td>
