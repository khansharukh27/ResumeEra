            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}

            />
          ))}
                <p>Downloading your resume as a PDF offers several advantages. Let’s dive into each benefit to understand why this format is the best choice for job applications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ensures Layout Consistency:</strong> PDFs preserve your resume's formatting, making sure your font, margins, and structure appear exactly as you intended. Whether the hiring manager opens it on a PC, Mac, or mobile device, the formatting won’t change. This is a major advantage over Word or Google Docs, which might appear differently depending on the software or settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe and Secure:</strong> PDFs are harder to edit, which helps protect your content from unwanted changes. Employers and recruiters can’t easily modify your resume, which ensures that the information you present is accurate and unaltered.</li>
                    <li><strong>ATS-Friendly:</strong> Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are used by many employers to filter and screen resumes. PDF files are generally ATS-compatible, ensuring your resume makes it through the system and into the hands of hiring managers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact File Size:</strong> PDFs are compressed, meaning they typically have smaller file sizes compared to other formats like Word or PowerPoint. This is beneficial when submitting multiple applications or attaching your resume to emails.</li>
                </ul>
