          <h2>🔍 Deciphering the Resume Format Code: Chronological, Functional, or Combination? 🧩</h2>
          <p>Choosing the best resume format is crucial for success. 🚀 Let’s break down the three most popular options:</p>

          <h3>📜 1. Chronological Resume Format PDF</h3>
          <p>
            This classic format presents your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent position. It’s a straightforward way to demonstrate career progression and is often preferred by recruiters due to its familiarity.
          </p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Familiar to most recruiters and hiring managers.</li>
            <li>✅ Clearly showcases career progression.</li>
            <li>✅ Easy to scan and understand.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Cons:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>⚠️ Can highlight employment gaps.</li>
            <li>⚠️ May not be suitable for career changers or those with diverse work experiences.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Individuals with a consistent work history who want to highlight their career growth within a specific industry.

          <h3>🎨 2. Functional Resume Format PDF</h3>
          <p>
            This format focuses on your skills and abilities rather than your chronological work history. It’s ideal for highlighting transferable skills and downplaying any potential employment gaps.
          </p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Emphasizes skills and accomplishments over work history.</li>
            <li>✅ Ideal for career changers or those with gaps in employment.</li>
            <li>✅ Allows for creative presentation of skills and experience.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Cons:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>⚠️ Less common and may be confusing for some recruiters.</li>
            <li>⚠️ Can be challenging to effectively showcase career progression.</li>
            <li>⚠️ May raise red flags if not used strategically.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Career changers, freelancers, or individuals with significant employment gaps who want to emphasize their skills. See <Link to="/resume-tips-for-recent-graduates">Resume Tips for Recent Graduates</Link> for skill-focused advice.</p>

          <h3>⚡ 3. Combination Resume Format PDF</h3>
          <p>
            This format blends elements of both chronological and functional formats. It allows you to highlight both your skills and your work experience in a balanced way.
          </p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Offers the best of both worlds – highlighting skills and work history.</li>
            <li>✅ Suitable for a wide range of job seekers.</li>
            <li>✅ Can be tailored to specific job requirements.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Cons:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>⚠️ Can be more time-consuming to create.</li>
            <li>⚠️ Requires careful structuring to avoid overwhelming the reader.</li>
