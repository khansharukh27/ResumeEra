The right format makes it easy for potential employers to find the information they need quickly and efficiently ‚ö°. The main goal of a resume format is to highlight your skills, experience, and qualifications in the most professional way possible üéØ.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Types of Resume Formats üìÑ</h2>
          <p>There are three main types of resume formats: Chronological, Functional, and Combination. Let‚Äôs take a look at each one to help you decide which format works best for you üëÄ.</p>

          <h3>1. Chronological Resume Format ‚è≥</h3>
          {[selectedimage].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
          <p>The chronological resume format is the most commonly used format. It‚Äôs ideal if you have a solid and consistent work history. This format lists your work experience in reverse chronological order, with your most recent job at the top. It also highlights your education and skills in separate sections.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with a steady career path and relevant experience for the job they‚Äôre applying for.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy for recruiters to follow üë©‚Äçüíª.</li>
            <li>Highlights your work experience and career progression üìà.</li>
            <li>Shows a clear timeline of your professional history üóìÔ∏è.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can highlight employment gaps if you‚Äôve had breaks between jobs üö´.</li>
            <li>Less suitable for people changing careers or entering the job market for the first time üîÑ.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Functional Resume Format üõ†Ô∏è</h3>
          {[selectedimage2].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
          <p>The functional resume format focuses on your skills and qualifications rather than your work history. This format is perfect for those who are changing careers, have gaps in their employment history, or are just starting out.</p>
          <p>In a functional resume, you emphasize your abilities and achievements by grouping them under skill-based headings such as ‚ÄúLeadership,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunication,‚Äù or ‚ÄúProject Management.‚Äù</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with little or no work experience, those changing careers, or those with employment gaps.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shifts the focus from employment gaps to skills üí™.</li>
            <li>Allows you to highlight transferable skills that apply to your desired position üìä.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Employers may be hesitant, as it doesn‚Äôt showcase your work history üòï.</li>
            <li>Makes it difficult for recruiters to understand the timeline of your experience ‚è≥.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Combination Resume Format üîÑ</h3>
          {[selectedimage6].map((image) => (
            <ImageCard
              key={image.id}
              image={image}
              hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
              setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
              handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}

            />
          ))}
          <p>The combination <Link to='https://resumeera.xyz/resume-format'>resume format</Link> blends elements of both the chronological and functional formats. It allows you to highlight your skills and qualifications while still showing your work history. This format is especially useful for people who have significant work experience but also want to highlight specific skills that make them ideal candidates for the job.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with a strong career history who want to emphasize skills.</p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides a well-rounded view of your skills and experience üõ†Ô∏è.</li>
            <li>Lets you showcase your most relevant skills for the job üéØ.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can become a bit long or complex if not formatted well üßê.</li>
            <li>Requires careful balance between skills and work history ‚öñÔ∏è.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Elements of a Resume Format üìù</h2>
          <p>No matter which resume format you choose, there are several key elements that should be included in your resume. These elements help ensure that your resume presents you in the best light possible üåü. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what should go into your resume:</p>
          <div className="qoute">
            <h3 className="qoute">1. Header üìã</h3>
            <p>Your header should include your name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable). It‚Äôs important to make sure this information is easy to read and up-to-date üïí. For example:</p>

            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="qoute">
            <h3>2. Career Summary or Objective üéØ</h3>
            <p>The career summary or objective statement gives the reader an overview of your experience, skills, and career goals. The career summary is a short paragraph that highlights your qualifications. If you‚Äôre just starting out or changing careers, you can write an objective instead, which focuses more on your aspirations and goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Career Summary Example:</strong> ‚ÄúDynamic marketing professional with 5+ years of experience in digital advertising and brand strategy. Proven track record of driving engagement and increasing brand awareness.‚Äù</p>
            <p><strong>Objective Example:</strong> ‚ÄúRecent college graduate seeking an entry-level marketing role to apply my skills in content creation and data analysis.‚Äù</p>

              </li>
            </ul>

          </div>

          <div className="qoute">
            <h3>4. Education üéì</h3>
            <p>In this section, list your degrees, certifications, and any relevant coursework.
              If you have a degree or diploma, you don‚Äôt need to include high school education

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Degree:</strong> Bachelor of Science in Marketing</li>

          <div className="qoute">
            <h3>5. Skills üõ†Ô∏è</h3>
            <p>The skills section should highlight key abilities that are relevant to the job you‚Äôre
