                    <h2>Steps to Write a Resume for a 12th Pass Student</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a resume that stands out, even with no work experience. For detailed formatting tips, visit <a href="https://resumeera.xyz/resume-format-for-freshers">resume format for freshers</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Start with Contact Information</h3>
                    <p>Include your full name, phone number, and a professional email address at the top. Avoid quirky emails like “coolkid123@gmail.com”—use something simple like “rahul.sharma@gmail.com”.</p>
                    <p className="examplegeneral"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                    <ul className="strong-point">
                        <li>Rahul Sharma</li>
                        <li>(+91) 98765-43210</li>
                        <li>rahul.sharma@email.com</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. Write a Strong Objective</h3>
                    <p>A short objective tells employers what you’re looking for and what you bring to the table. Keep it focused on your goals as a 12th pass student. Learn how at <a href="https://resumeera.xyz/how-to-write-a-strong-resume-objective">how to write a strong resume objective</a>.</p>
                    <p className="examplegeneral"><strong>Example:</strong><br /> "A dedicated 12th pass student with a Commerce background seeking a part-time accounting assistant role to apply my numerical skills and eagerness to learn."</p>

                    <h3>3. Highlight Your Education</h3>

                    <h3>4. List Relevant Skills</h3>
