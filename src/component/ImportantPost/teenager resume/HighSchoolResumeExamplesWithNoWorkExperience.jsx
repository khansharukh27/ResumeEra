                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even with solid <strong>high school resume examples with no work experience</strong>, avoid these five mistakes in your teen resume format:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Spelling Errors</strong>
                            <p>
                                Typos like “teemwork” look sloppy. Proofread twice to catch every mistake.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Too Much Info</strong>
                            <p>
                                Keep it to one page—don’t add fluff. See <Link to="/common-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-resume">common resume mistakes</Link>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fancy Designs</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bright colors or wild fonts confuse readers. Stick to simple black text and Arial.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                “Did stuff” isn’t enough—say “Organized a club event” in your teen resume format.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Not Customizing</strong>
                            <p>
                                Tweak your <strong>high school resume examples with no work experience</strong> for each goal—jobs, college, or internships.
                            </p>

                    </ol>
