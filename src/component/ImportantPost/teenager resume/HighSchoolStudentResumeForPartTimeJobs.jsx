                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid on Your Resume</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even with a great <strong>high school student resume for part-time jobs</strong>, avoid these five mistakes in your teen resume format:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Spelling Errors</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Teemwork” looks sloppy—proofread twice to catch errors.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Too Much Info</strong>
                            <p>
                                Keep it one page—don’t overload it. See <Link to="/common-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-resume">common resume mistakes</Link>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fancy Designs</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bright colors or wild fonts confuse employers—use Arial in black.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Vague Details</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Did stuff” isn’t enough—say “Helped at school events” in your teen resume format.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Not Customizing</strong>
                            <p>
                                Tailor your <strong>high school student resume for part-time jobs</strong>—match it to the job type.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
