          <h2>Pitfalls to Dodge in Entry-Level Resume Examples for High School Students</h2>
          <p>
            Even the best entry-level resume examples for high school students can falter if you miss these traps. Here are five mistakes to avoid, so your high school student resume shines for entry-level roles in 2025.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Typos That Trip You Up</strong>
              <p>
                A typo, like “comunication,” can make you look unprepared. Proofread twice—read aloud or ask a friend to check before finishing your entry-level resume examples for high school students.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resumes That Run Long</strong>
              <p>
                One page is ideal. Employers and internship coordinators skim fast—don’t let a long high school student resume fade away. Keep your entry-level resume examples for high school students concise.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unprofessional Emails</strong>
              <p>
                “Coolkid2025@gmail.com” won’t impress. Use a clean email, like “firstname.lastname@gmail.com,” for your teen entry-level resume.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Details</strong>
              <p>
                “Helped at school” is unclear. Be specific, like “Organized a fundraiser for the art club, 2024.” Clear entries boost your entry-level resume examples for high school students.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Matching the Role</strong>
              <p>
                Don’t use the same high school student resume for every job or internship. Tailor it—tech skills for tech roles, customer service for retail. This is key for entry-level resume examples for high school students.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            “Entry-level resume examples for high school students should be clear and custom—skip these slips,” says Megan White, a youth job coach. Avoid these with free tools from ResumeEra.xyz to craft a winning high school student resume.
