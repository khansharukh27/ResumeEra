                    <h2>Pick the Right First Job Resume Format and Template</h2>
                    <p>Choosing the right resume format is crucial for crafting a standout student resume for your first job. There are three primary resume formats to choose from, each focusing on different aspects of your experience:</p>

                    <h3>Reverse-Chronological Resume</h3>
                    <p>This is the most common and widely accepted resume format.
                        It lists your work experiences and education in <Link to="/chronological-resume-formatting-experienced-candidates">reverse-chronological</Link> order,
                        starting with the most recent. This format works well if you have internship
                        experience or part-time jobs to showcase. It's great for students who’ve
                        gained practical experience in their field or through relevant internships.</p>
                        <div><GoogleAd/></div>
                    <h3>Functional Resume</h3>
                    <p>A <Link to='/chronological-resume-formatting-experienced-candidates'>functional resume</Link> shifts the focus from work experience to skills and achievements.
                        This format is ideal for those with limited work experience,
                        like fresh graduates or students who have not yet had formal employment.
                        If you’re just starting out, highlighting your skills—such as communication,
                        problem-solving, or leadership—can be more beneficial than emphasizing job history.</p>
                    {[selectedimage2].map((image) => (
                        <ImageCard
                            key={image.id}
                            image={image}
                            hoveredImage={hoveredImage}
                            setHoveredImage={setHoveredImage}
                            handleClick={(e) => handleClick(e, image.id)}
                        />
                    ))}
                    <h3>Combination (Hybrid) Resume</h3>
                    <div><GoogleAd/></div>
                    <p>This format combines elements from both the reverse-chronological and functional resumes. It highlights your skills and experience, offering a well-rounded view of your qualifications. This format is ideal for students who have gained experience through internships, part-time jobs, or relevant volunteer activities, allowing you to showcase both your skills and experiences effectively.</p>

                    <h3>Which Resume Format Should You Choose?</h3>
                    <p>For most students or freshers, the reverse-chronological format is the best option—especially if you’ve had internships or part-time jobs. This format is widely used by recruiters and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), making it a safer choice for getting noticed.</p>

                    <p>If you're someone without any professional experience, a functional resume might be a better fit. Focus on skills, volunteer experiences, and academic achievements to make a lasting impression.</p>

                    <h3>How to Format Your Resume</h3>
                    <p>Once you've chosen the right format, it’s time to focus on the layout and design. Here are some tips to make your resume visually appealing and easy to read:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a Two-Column Layout: This allows you to organize your content efficiently and make better use of space.</li>
                        <li>Pick a Professional Font: Stick with simple, clean fonts like Arial, Roboto, or Calibri.</li>
                        <li>Use Bullets for Clarity: Bulleted lists make your responsibilities and achievements easy to scan.</li>
                        <li>Stick to One Page: As a fresher or a student with limited experience, try to keep your resume to a single page.</li>
                    </ul>
