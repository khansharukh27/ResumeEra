                    <h3>2. Objective Statement</h3>
                    <p>An Objective Statement is a brief paragraph at the top of your resume that describes your career goals and why you're interested in the position. This is your opportunity to introduce yourself to the hiring manager and show them your enthusiasm for the job.</p>
                    <p>Your objective should be clear, concise, and specific to the job you’re applying for. Even as a 15-year-old with little work experience, employers are looking for candidates who are motivated, eager to learn, and ready to contribute.</p>

                    <h4>Why is an Objective Statement Important?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First Impression:</strong> It’s your first opportunity to make a strong impression. It lets the employer know why you’re applying and how you can add value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> It should clearly express your interest in the job, showcasing what skills or qualities you can bring to the table.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeted:</strong> Tailor your objective statement to each job. This shows that you’re truly interested in that particular role.</li>

                        <li><strong>Keep it short and sweet:</strong> Your objective statement should be about 2-3 sentences long.</li>
                        <li><strong>Highlight transferable skills:</strong> Even if you don’t have formal work experience, talk about skills you've gained from school, extracurricular activities, or volunteer work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be positive and enthusiastic:</strong> Use words like “eager to learn,” “dedicated,” “motivated,” and “enthusiastic.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Tailor it to the job:</strong> Make sure your objective matches the position you’re applying for. For example, if you’re applying for a customer service job, mention your interest in interacting with people and solving problems.</li>

                    <h3>4. Skills</h3>
                    <p>The Skills section of your resume is where you'll highlight the strengths, abilities, and characteristics that make you an asset to potential employers. As a 15-year-old applying for your first job, it’s important to emphasize your transferable skills—those that you’ve developed through school, extracurricular activities, and personal experiences. Even without formal work experience, you likely possess valuable skills that employers will appreciate.</p>

                    <h4>Why is the Skills Section Important?</h4>
