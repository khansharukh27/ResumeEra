                    <h2>Essential Sections for a Student Resume</h2>
                    <p>When you're building your resume for the first time, it helps to know what sections to include. Here's a breakdown of the must-haves:</p>

                    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                    <p>Start with your contact details at the top of the page. Make sure to include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your full name (use a slightly larger font to make it stand out).</li>
                        <li>A professional email address—avoid anything too casual like "coolkid123@gmail.com."</li>
                        <li>Your phone number with a voicemail that includes your name.</li>
                        <li>Your city and state if you're applying locally. Skip this if you're looking for remote or long-distance jobs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This section is simple but crucial. It ensures employers can easily reach you.</p>

                    <h3> <Link to='/attention-grabbing-resume-summary'>Resume Objective or Summary</Link></h3>
                    <p>Think of this as your introduction. It's a short statement that highlights your goals and strengths. For example:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Motivated high school student with strong organizational skills and a passion for customer service. Seeking a part-time role to gain hands-on experience."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This section grabs attention and shows you're serious about the opportunity.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>Your education section is where you shine as a student. Include:</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                            <tr>
                                <td>Name of the institution</td>
                                <td>Lincoln High School</td>

                        <li><strong>Extracurricular activities:</strong> Highlight leadership roles or teamwork skills. For example, being a team captain shows responsibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Side projects:</strong> If you've done anything creative or technical, like starting a blog or coding a website, mention it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These experiences show you're proactive and willing to learn.</p>

                    <h3>Skills</h3>
                    <p>Wrap up your resume with a skills section. Focus on abilities that match the job. Examples include:</p>

                    <h2>Tips to Make Your Resume Stand Out</h2>

                    <h3>Use Action Verbs and Quantify Achievements</h3>
                    <p>Action verbs can make your resume more dynamic and impactful. Instead of saying, "I was responsible for organizing events," try using verbs like "coordinated," "executed," or "spearheaded." These words show initiative and leadership. Here are some examples of action verbs you can use:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administered</li>
                        <li>Designed</li>
                        <li>Implemented</li>
                        <li>Boosted</li>
                        <li>Managed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Quantifying your achievements takes it a step further. Numbers make your accomplishments more concrete. For example, instead of saying, "Organized club meetings," you could say, "Spearheaded monthly meetings for the environmental club with 50+ attendees." Highlighting measurable results, like increasing membership by 30% or raising $1,000 for a fundraiser, makes your resume stand out.</p>

                        <h3>How to Tailor Your Resume to the Job Description</h3>
                        <p>When applying for a job, it's important to customize your resume so it matches the specific role you're applying for. By doing this, you show the employer that you took the time to understand the position and that you’re a great fit for it.</p>
