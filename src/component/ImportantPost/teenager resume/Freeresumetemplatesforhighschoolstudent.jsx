                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid with Free Resume Templates for High School Students</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even with great <strong>free resume templates for high school students</strong>, avoid these five mistakes in your teen resume format:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Typos</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Teemwork” looks sloppy—proofread twice to fix errors.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Overloading</strong>
                            <p>
                                Keep it one page—don’t cram too much. See <Link to="/common-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-resume">common resume mistakes</Link>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fancy Fonts</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bright colors or wild fonts confuse readers—use Arial in black.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Vague Info</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Did stuff” won’t cut it—say “Organized club events” in your teen resume format.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Not Customizing</strong>
                            <p>
                                Tailor your <strong>free resume templates for high school students</strong>—don’t use the same one for every goal.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        “Keep it simple and tailored,” says Mark Torres, a resume expert. Avoid these with <strong>free resume templates for high school students</strong> from ResumeEra.xyz.
