                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid with Skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even the best skills for teenager resume examples can flop if you mess up. Watch out for these five mistakes:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Typos in Skills</strong>
                            <p>
                                A typo like “comunication” looks sloppy. Readers might think you’re careless. Double-check every skill.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Listing Too Many</strong>
                            <p>
                                Overloading with 15 skills is too much—stick to five or seven. Keep it short so it’s easy to read.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Being Too Vague</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Good at stuff” says nothing. Use specifics like “Good at teamwork from sports.”
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lying About Skills</strong>
                            <p>
                                Don’t claim coding if you can’t code. Honesty keeps you credible.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ignoring Relevance</strong>
                            <p>
                                Random skills like “great at video games” won’t help unless they fit the goal. Match them to your purpose.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        “Skills need to be clear and real,” says John Smith, a resume expert. Avoid these pitfalls with help from ResumeEra.xyz.

                                You don’t need a ton of experience! Include skills like teamwork from sports, communication from school projects, or tech skills like using Microsoft Word. Things like being punctual, organized, or creative also count. Focus on what you’re good at—clubs, volunteering, or hobbies can show these off. Tailor them to your goal, like jobs or college.

                                Aim for five to seven skills on your teenager resume. This keeps it short and sweet for employers or colleges to read quickly.
