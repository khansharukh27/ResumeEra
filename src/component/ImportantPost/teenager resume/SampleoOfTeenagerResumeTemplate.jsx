                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid with a Sample of Teenager Resume Template</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even a great sample of teenager resume template can flop if you mess up. Here are five mistakes to skip:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Typos and Errors</strong>
                            <p>
                                A misspelled word looks unprofessional. Proofread twice to fix every mistake.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Adding Too Much</strong>
                            <p>
                                One page is enough—don’t cram in extra fluff. Keep it short and focused.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Using a Complicated Design</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bright colors or fancy fonts confuse readers. Stick to simple black text and Arial.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ignoring Details</strong>
                            <p>
                                Vague entries like “Helped out” won’t work. Use specifics like “Organized club meetings.”
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Forgetting to Customize</strong>
                            <p>
                                Don’t use the same sample for every goal. Tweak it for jobs, college, or internships.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
