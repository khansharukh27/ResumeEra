          <h2>Pitfalls to Skip with Tips for Creating a Teenage Internship Resume</h2>
          <p>
            Even with the best tips for creating a teenage internship resume, mistakes can trip you up. Here are five traps to avoid, so your teen internship resume shines in 2025, following high school student internship resume advice.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Typos That Undercut You</strong>
              <p>
                A typo, like “comunication,” can make you look unprepared. Proofread twice—read aloud or ask a friend to check, per teen internship resume tips, before finalizing your high school student internship resume.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resumes That Stretch Too Long</strong>
              <p>
                One page is your goal. Internship coordinators skim fast—don’t let a long resume fade away. Keep your tips for creating a teenage internship resume concise and focused.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unprofessional Emails</strong>
              <p>
                “Skaterkid99@gmail.com” won’t impress. Use a clean email, like “firstname.lastname@gmail.com,” for your teen internship resume, per best practices for teen internship resumes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Entries</strong>
              <p>
                “Helped at school” is unclear. Be specific, like “Organized a fundraiser for the art club, 2024.” Clear details strengthen your tips for creating a teenage internship resume.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Tailoring to the Internship</strong>
              <p>
                Don’t use the same high school student internship resume for every role. Customize it—tech skills for coding gigs, creativity for marketing. This is vital in tips for creating a teenage internship resume.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            “Tips for creating a teenage internship resume should keep it clear and custom—avoid these missteps,” says Tom Rivera, an internship expert. Sidestep these with free tools from ResumeEra.xyz to build a winning teen internship resume.
