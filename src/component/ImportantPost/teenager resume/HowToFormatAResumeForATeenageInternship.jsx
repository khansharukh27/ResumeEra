                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Formatting Your Resume</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even with tips on <strong>how to format a resume for a teenage internship</strong>, avoid these five mistakes in your teen resume format:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Spelling Errors</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Teemwork” looks unprofessional—proofread twice.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Too Long</strong>
                            <p>
                                Keep it one page—don’t overload it. See <Link to="/common-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-resume">common resume mistakes</Link>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Overly Fancy Design</strong>
                            <p>
                                Bright colors or wild fonts distract—use Arial in black.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Vague Details</strong>
                            <p>
                                “Did stuff” won’t work—say “Led club projects” in your teen resume format.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Not Tailoring</strong>
                            <p>
                                Customize your <strong>how to format a resume for a teenage internship</strong>—match it to the internship type.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        “A clean format wins,” says Mark Torres, a resume expert. Avoid these with help from ResumeEra.xyz.
