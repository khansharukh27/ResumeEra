                    <h2>1. What to Include in a Teenager Resume</h2>
                    <p>The resume is usually quite different from those of seasoned professionals, as it highlights different areas. Here's a breakdown of what to include:</p>
                    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full Name</li>

                        jane.doe@email.com
                    </p>
                    <h3>Objective or Summary (Optional)</h3>
                    <p>An objective or summary section is optional but can provide a brief overview of your career goals and aspirations. For example, a teenager looking for a part-time job might write:</p>
                    <p className="examplegeneral"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                    <p className="strong-point">

                    <h3>Education</h3>
