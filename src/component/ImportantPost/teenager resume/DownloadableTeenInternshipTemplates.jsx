            Even with a great teen resume format, avoid these traps on your <strong>high school internship resume with no experience</strong>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Spelling Errors</strong>
              <p>
                “Teemwork” instead of “teamwork” looks sloppy. Proofread your <strong>high school internship resume with no experience</strong>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Too Long</strong>
              <p>
                Keep it one page—busy coordinators won’t read more. See <Link to="/one-vs-multi-page-resume">one vs. multi-page resume</Link>.

              <strong>Unprofessional Email</strong>

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Details</strong>
              <p>
