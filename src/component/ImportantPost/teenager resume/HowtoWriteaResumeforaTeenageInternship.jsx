          <h2>Mistakes to Avoid When You Write a Resume for a Teenage Internship</h2>
          <p>
            Even the best guide on how to write a resume for a teenage internship can trip you up if you miss these pitfalls. Here are five traps to dodge, so your teenage internship resume shines bright in 2025.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Typo Traps</strong>
              <p>
                A typo, like “comunication,” can make you look careless. Proofread twice—read it out loud or ask a friend to check before you finalize your teenage internship resume online.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Length Landmines</strong>
              <p>
                Stick to one page. Internship coordinators skim fast—don’t let a long resume fade into the background. Keep your resume for a teenage internship short and sharp.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unprofessional Email Oops</strong>
              <p>
                “Coolkid2025@gmail.com” won’t impress. Use a clean email, like “firstname.lastname@gmail.com,” to keep your teenage internship resume looking pro.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Vibes</strong>
              <p>
                “Helped at school” is fuzzy. Be specific, like “Organized a fundraiser for the science club, 2024.” Clear details make your resume for a teenage internship stand out.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generic Gaffes</strong>
              <p>
                Don’t use the same teenage internship resume for every gig. Tailor it—tech skills for coding roles, creativity for marketing. It’s like picking the right tool for the job!
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            “How to write a resume for a teenage internship should be clear and custom—avoid these slips,” advises Sarah Nguyen, an internship specialist. Steer clear with free tools from ResumeEra.xyz to craft a winning teenage internship resume.
