          <h2>Pitfalls to Avoid with High School Student Resume Templates for Internships</h2>
          <p>
            Even the best high school student resume templates for internships can falter if you miss these traps. Here are five mistakes to dodge, so your teenage resume for internships shines in 2025.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Typos That Throw You Off</strong>
              <p>
                A misspelling, like “comunication,” can make you look unready. Proofread twice—read aloud or ask a friend to check before finalizing your high school student resume templates for internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resumes That Stretch Too Far</strong>
              <p>
                One page is enough. Internship coordinators skim fast—don’t let a long resume fade away. Keep your high school student resume templates for internships short and sharp.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unprofessional Emails</strong>
              <p>
                “Partyrocker99@gmail.com” won’t impress. Use a clean email, like “firstname.lastname@gmail.com,” for your teenage resume for internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Entries</strong>
              <p>
                “Helped at school” is unclear. Be specific, like “Organized a fundraiser for the science club, 2024.” Clear details boost your high school student resume templates for internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Matching the Internship</strong>
              <p>
                Don’t use the same teenage resume for every internship. Tailor it—tech skills for coding roles, creativity for marketing. This is key for high school student resume templates for internships.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            “High school student resume templates for internships should be clear and custom—avoid these slips,” says Claire Adams, an internship recruiter. Skip these pitfalls with free tools from ResumeEra.xyz to build a winning teenage resume for internships.
