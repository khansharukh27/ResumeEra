                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even with great <strong>skills to include on a high school internship resume</strong>, avoid these five mistakes in your teen resume format:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Listing Irrelevant Skills</strong>
                            <p>
                                Skip “gaming”—focus on skills like “teamwork” that match the internship.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                “Good at stuff” won’t work—say “Communication – Led class discussions.” Specifics matter in <strong>skills to include on a high school internship resume</strong>. See <Link to="/common-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-resume">common resume mistakes</Link>.

                            <p>
                                5-7 skills max—don’t clutter your teen resume format with too many.

                            <p>
                                Prove it—pair “Leadership” with “Led club projects” for a strong teen resume format.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Customize your <strong>skills to include on a high school internship resume</strong> to the internship—tech skills for IT, creativity for art.
                            </p>
                        </li>
