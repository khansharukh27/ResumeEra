          <h2>Traps to Avoid in the Best Resume Format for Teen Internships</h2>
          <p>
            Even the best resume format for teen internships can stumble if you miss these pitfalls. Here are five mistakes to dodge, so your teen resume format shines for internships in 2025.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Typos That Dim Your Shine</strong>
              <p>
                A typo, like “comunication,” can make you look unready. Proofread twice—read aloud or ask a friend to check before finalizing your best resume format for teen internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resumes That Stretch Too Long</strong>
              <p>
                One page is the sweet spot. Internship coordinators skim fast—don’t let a long resume fade away. Keep your teen resume format concise in the best resume format for teen internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unprofessional Emails</strong>
              <p>
                “Skaterkid123@gmail.com” won’t impress. Use a clean email, like “firstname.lastname@gmail.com,” for your teenage resume for internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vague Entries</strong>
              <p>
                “Helped at school” is unclear. Be specific, like “Organized a fundraiser for the art club, 2024.” Clear details boost your best resume format for teen internships.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not Tailoring to the Internship</strong>
              <p>
                Don’t use the same teen resume format for every internship. Customize it—tech skills for coding roles, creativity for marketing. This is key for the best resume format for teen internships.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
