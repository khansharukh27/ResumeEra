  <h2>✨ Why a Great Resume Format Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Your resume format is more than just a design choice; it’s a strategic tool to make your skills and experience shine. A well-organized resume format ensures that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>📌 Key Information Stands Out:</strong> Hiring managers can quickly find your qualifications and relevant details.</li>
    <li><strong>⚙️ Your Resume Is ATS-Friendly:</strong> Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. A clear and simple format ensures your resume passes the initial screening.</li>
    <li><strong>💼 Professional Presentation:</strong> A neat and visually appealing resume creates a positive first impression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📂 Types of Resume Formats</h2>
  <p>
    Choosing the right resume format depends on your experience, skills, and the job you’re applying for. Here are the three most common types:
  </p>

  <h3>1️⃣ Chronological Resume Format</h3>
  <p>
    The chronological format is ideal for individuals with consistent work experience. It lists your professional history in reverse chronological order.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> 🏢 Experienced professionals and individuals with a stable career path.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> 🕒 Work experience, job titles, and tenure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2️⃣ Functional Resume Format</h3>
  <p>
    The functional format focuses on skills and abilities rather than chronological work history. It’s perfect for those with gaps in employment or those transitioning into new industries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> 🔄 Career changers, fresh graduates, or individuals with diverse experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> 🛠️ Skills, competencies, and achievements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3️⃣ Combination Resume Format</h3>
  <p>
    The combination format merges the best of chronological and functional formats. It highlights skills while providing a detailed work history.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Best For:</strong> 🌟 Professionals with extensive experience and diverse skill sets.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> 📜 Both skills and experience.</li>
  </ul>
