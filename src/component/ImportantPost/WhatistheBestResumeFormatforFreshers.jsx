                    <h2>Why is a Resume Important for Freshers?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A resume is a crucial tool for freshers to introduce themselves to potential employers. It’s not just a list of your qualifications and experiences; it's an opportunity to highlight your strengths, ambitions, and readiness to contribute to a company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For freshers, the resume format is even more important as it’s often the first impression you make. Without much work experience, your resume must focus on education, skills, internships, and projects that demonstrate your ability to succeed in the role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A resume is a document that summarizes your skills, qualifications, and experience in a way that presents you as a suitable candidate for a job. Different types of resumes are used depending on your experience, skills, and career goals. Below are the most common types of resumes along with examples and explanations:

                        <p>Including references is optional. However, it can be beneficial if you have someone who can vouch for your skills and character, such as a professor or an internship supervisor. Make sure to ask for permission before listing someone as a reference.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <pre>
                            References:<br />
                            Available upon request.<br />
                            Alternatively, you can list one or two references<br />
                            with their full name, position, contact information, and relationship to you.<br />
                        </pre>

                        <li><strong>Format Consistently:</strong> Use a clean, simple format that’s easy to read. Avoid excessive fonts, colors, or designs.</li>
