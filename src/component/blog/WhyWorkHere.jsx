          <h2>Why Do Interviewers Ask “Why Do You Want to Work Here?”</h2>
          <p>
            When employers ask, <strong>“Why do you want to work here?”</strong>, they are trying to assess a few critical
            things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Have you done your research?</strong> Employers want to see if you've taken the time to learn about
              their company, its culture, and its mission. This shows that you’re genuinely interested in the position.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Are you passionate about this job?</strong> They want to know why you’ve chosen <strong>this specific job</strong>.
              Employers prefer candidates who are not just looking for any job, but who are motivated by the opportunity to
              work at their company.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Do you fit with the company culture?</strong> Every company has its own unique culture. The hiring manager
              wants to see if you’re a good fit based on your personal values, work ethic, and long-term goals.

          <h2>3 Bad Answers to Avoid in Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            The wrong answer can hurt your chances. Here are <strong>three bad answers</strong> to the question <strong>“Why do you want to work here?”</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>"I just need a job."</strong> This shows you’re indifferent about the role, implying you’ll take any position. It fails to show
              your interest in the specific company or job.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"I could really use the money."</strong> While it's true that most of us work to earn a living, focusing on money sends the wrong
              message. It makes you seem uninterested in the company’s mission or values.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>"This job will be a great stepping stone."</strong> Employers want candidates who are committed for the long term. By calling the job
              a “stepping stone,” you imply that you’ll leave as soon as a better offer comes along.

          <h3>4. Mention the Company Culture</h3>
          <p>
