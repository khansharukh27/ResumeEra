        <p>
          As an interview draws to a close, it’s likely the interviewer will ask,
          “Do you have any questions for me?” While it may feel like everything
          has already been covered during the interview, your response to this
          question is an opportunity to leave a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though coming up with questions can be tricky, it's always better
          to respond with a question rather than politely declining. Declining
          could make you seem disengaged or uninterested in the role. Let’s
          explore tips on how to respond strategically and which questions to
          avoid.

        <h2>What the Interviewer Wants to Know</h2>
        <p>
          Interviewers ask this question to give you a chance to clarify doubts
          and learn more about the role and the company. Additionally, it’s a
          way for them to assess if you’ve prepared and are genuinely interested
          in the position.

        <h2>How to Prepare for the Question</h2>
        <p>
          Since this is a common question at the end of interviews, it’s
          essential to prepare in advance. Develop a list of questions, keeping
          in mind that some might already be covered during the interview. Your
          questions can vary based on your interviewer’s role, such as HR
          personnel or the hiring manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prepare multiple questions, as the conversation may naturally answer
          some of them. Ensure your questions are thoughtful and reflect your
          understanding of the company and role.
