                    "One of the accomplishments I am most proud of was completing my final-year project on <em>AI-Powered Resume Builders</em>.
                    I led a team of four to create a fully functional prototype that was appreciated during our university’s innovation expo.
                    This experience taught me the value of teamwork, meeting deadlines, and delivering results. I believe these skills will
