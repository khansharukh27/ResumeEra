        <h2>Examples of Weaknesses and How to Present Them</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Public Speaking</h3>
        <p>“I have struggled with public speaking in the past, which has been challenging in roles that involve presentations. To improve, I’ve taken public speaking courses and actively look for opportunities to present in team meetings. This has helped me become more comfortable and improve my communication skills.”</p>

        <h3>2. Perfectionism</h3>
        <p>“My attention to detail sometimes leads to perfectionism, which can slow me down. I’m learning to balance quality with efficiency by setting realistic goals and trusting in my skills and my team’s feedback.”</p>

        <h3>3. Delegation</h3>
        <p>“In the past, I found it challenging to delegate tasks, as I often felt I needed to manage everything myself. However, I’ve worked on building trust with my team and assigning tasks that play to each person’s strengths, which has improved both my productivity and team morale.”</p>

        <h3>4. Impatience with Slow Processes</h3>
        <p>“I tend to get impatient when projects move slower than expected, especially with administrative processes. To address this, I’ve focused on understanding the value of each step in a project and have found ways to keep myself engaged, ensuring I stay positive and focused.”</p>

        <h3>5. Balancing Multiple Projects</h3>
        <p>“Managing multiple projects was initially a challenge for me. I’ve since adopted a project management tool and have worked on improving my prioritization skills, which has helped me manage my workload more effectively.”</p>
