                <h2>Why Do Interviewers Ask This Question?</h2>
                <p>
                    A job interview is an important opportunity to tell a hiring manager more about yourself, your skills and your experience. If you work in a field where you deal directly with customers, you may want to prepare to answer interview questions about how you would handle a difficult customer.
                    In this article, we discuss why interviewers ask how we deal with a difficult customer and how to answer this question, and we provide tips and examples to help you prepare your own answer.  </p>

                <h2>What Interviewers Look for in an Answer</h2>
                <p>
                    Interviewers may ask questions about dealing with difficult customers in a
                    variety of ways. Some may ask general questions to discuss the subject and learn more about
                    your skills. Examples of general questions about difficult customers may include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What areas of customer service do you have experience with?</li>
                        <li>Tell me about a difficult task you faced. How did you address it?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interviewers may also frame questions about demanding customers as behavioral questions.
                    These questions assess how you acted in previous situations similar to what you may experience in the new
                    job. Examples of behavioral questions about difficult customers may include:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What's your approach to handling difficult customers? Please give a recent example.</li>
                    <li>Tell me about a time you dealt with an angry customer.            </li>
                    <li>Describe a situation when you had to deal with a difficult customer. How did you handle the situation?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Many interviewers include situational questions. These situations involve the interviewer
                    describing a situation and asking you how you would handle the situation.
                    Examples of situational questions about difficult customers may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An angry customer demands to speak with the manager. However, you know the manager is unavailable. What would you do next?</li>
                    <li>A frustrated customer walks into the store and asks for a refund, but they do not have a receipt. How would you handle the situation?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Structure Your Answer Using the STAR Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Briefly describe the context.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> Explain the issue that required action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Detail the steps you took to resolve the issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Conclude with the positive outcome of your actions.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Tips for Answering Questions About Difficult Customers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be HonestAvoid using humor:</strong> Some interviewers don't mind incorporating humor during your answers to help show your personality. However,
                        you can use humor in less serious or sensitive questions than ones about difficult customers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be mindful of your body language:</strong> Be aware of your facial
                        expressions when describing the situation.
                        The interviewer may consider your actions a reflection of how you interact with a face-to-face customer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Use respectful language when describing a difficult customer.
                        Choose words that
                        demonstrate you understood why the customer felt upset or frustrated and reflect your positive attitude.</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide a direct answer:</strong>Ensure you answer the question the interviewer asks you.
                        Avoid replying that you avoid or dislike conflict, and use
                        the question as an opportunity to demonstrate your customer service skills and confidence in your abilities.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Tell the truth:</strong>Be honest when discussing your experience with conflict. 
                            To ensure you provide an honest answer, think about your previous experience working with others, 
                            and consider asking if you may use an example of working with someone difficult if you need to.

                <h2>Sample Answers</h2>
                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>Situation:</em> ""I recently worked as a customer service representative
                    in the support department at a cable and internet service company. Our company increased monthly rates by a
                    small amount for all of our customers, and we sent multiple notices to customers in the six months leading up to the rate increase. However, many customers ignored the increase notices, and, as a result, many customers called us to complain about the rate increases.
                    Many of my colleagues and I found it frustrating to receive these calls because it meant we had less time to help
                    customers with other issues. I approached my supervisor and proposed we send another notice to all of our customers
                    and update our telephone menu messaging to educate customers and redirect their calls specifically to
                    representatives handling billing. Also, based on our feedback and customer feedback, the company gave all
                    customers a prorated rebate. As a result, we received fewer customer complaints overall, and the customers who
                    called felt more satisfied with their experience and listened to by the company."
                </p>
                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>Task:</em> "When I worked as a barista, a customer came into our store and complained that their drink was incorrect, and the drive-thru worker gave them the wrong breakfast sandwich. I apologized for the error and let them know we would be happy to remake their order for them free of charge. However, the customer still felt frustrated because they said waiting for a new order would make them late for work, and it was not the first time someone had made their order incorrectly.
                    To help ensure the customer received the order as soon as possible, I instructed our prep team to
                    prioritize making the new drink and sandwich. I asked the customer about their previous experiences,
                    and I shared tips on how to order their items in a way that may help prevent mistakes or incorrect items.
                    When I gave the customer their new order, I included our store manager's and district manager's business
                    cards and a few coupons for free drinks.
                    The customer thanked me for my help, felt much happier and even gave us a generous cash tip."</p>

                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>Task:</em> "If a customer demanded a refund without a receipt,
                    I would first apologize for their frustrations. I would ask if they paid with a credit card to
                    look up the purchase in our system. If they didn't or we couldn't find the receipt,
                    I would explain our return policy to them and discuss what options they had, such as
                    exchanging their item for something new or returning the item for store credit, and offer
                    to help them. I would be firm in my explanation, and, if the customer continued to resist,
                    I would escalate the situation.
                    I frequently handled situations like this when working at a body care store because customers often
                    received items as gifts that they did not like the scents of or would not use. Many customers would
                    request cash refunds without receipts, but this was against our policy. I would explain our
                    policies about store credit and exchanges and try to help them find products they liked to get
                    the most value for their returned items. This often helped customers feel satisfied, and many even spent
                    more money because they found new items they loved!"
