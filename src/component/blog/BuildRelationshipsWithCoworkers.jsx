                Focus on any past group projects, internships, or volunteer experiences where teamwork was involved.</p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example Answer for Freshers:</strong>"In college, I participated in several group projects and club activities, which taught me the importance of teamwork and open communication. I always made an effort to listen to everyone’s ideas and find ways to support my peers in achieving shared goals. For example, during a project, I organized a group meeting where we could openly discuss each member's strengths, helping us delegate tasks more effectively. I’m excited to bring this collaborative mindset to a professional environment and build strong connections with my new team."

                </li>
                <h3>For Intermediate-Level Employees:</h3>
                <p>Intermediate-level employees can highlight specific experiences and examples that show a balance of teamwork, problem-solving, and their evolving interpersonal skills. The answer should convey 
                    confidence in their approach to building relationships and adapting to different team dynamics.</p>

                    "In my previous role, I learned that building relationships is key to a supportive work environment. 
                    I prioritize active listening and empathy to understand my coworkers' perspectives and offer help whenever 
                    possible. For instance, when a team member was facing challenges with a project deadline, 
                    I volunteered to assist them in managing the workload, ensuring we met our goals on time. 
                    This experience taught me that small gestures can make a big 
                    difference in fostering trust and a positive team atmosphere, which I look forward to continuing in this role."

                        approach to relationship-building, contributing to team success and organizational goals.</p>
                        <li> <strong>Example Answer for Experienced Professionals:</strong>"Throughout my career, 
                        I’ve found that building strong relationships with coworkers is foundational for achieving both 
                        individual and team success. I make it a point to engage with my team through regular check-ins and by 
                        creating an open space for feedback. In my last role, I initiated weekly team meetings where everyone could 
                        share updates and discuss any challenges. This not only improved communication but also fostered trust and 
                        camaraderie. By understanding my colleagues’ strengths and challenges, I was able to facilitate collaboration, 
                        which consistently led to successful project outcomes. 
                        I look forward to bringing this approach to foster a positive team environment here." </li>
