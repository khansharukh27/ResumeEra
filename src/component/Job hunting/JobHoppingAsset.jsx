                    Job hopping, or frequently changing jobs, is often considered a red flag on your resume.
                    However, the reality isn’t so black and white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recent <a href="https://resumeera.xyz"> ResumeEra </a> survey shows that only half of hiring managers see frequent job
                    hopping as a red flag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This finding is encouraging for job seekers, who increasingly view job hopping as a valid
                    way to advance their careers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make sure you’re going about job-hopping the right way, we’ve prepared a guide to help
                    you frame switching jobs in a positive way:
                </p>

                <h2>Frame Job Hopping Positively in an Interview</h2>
                <p>
                    Even if half of hiring managers won’t disqualify you based on job hopping alone, they
                    still might ask about it in a job interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be prepared to explain why you changed jobs in a way that strengthens your chances of
                    getting hired by following these tips:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Assess Your Work History</h3>
                <p>
                    First, you should determine if your work history will be seen as job hopping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following is likely to be considered job hopping by employers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staying at a job for less than six months</li>
                    <li>Changing companies multiple times after less than a year</li>
                    <li>Quitting your job at a company and returning to it later</li>
                    <li>Not staying in any position for more than 18 months</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Be Honest About Your Job Hopping</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s important to be transparent about why you hopped jobs in your application because it
                    highlights your integrity and self-awareness. You can do this through your resume, cover
                    letters, and interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be prepared to answer questions about why you left one job for another, and why you only
                    stayed in a previous role for a certain period of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frame your reason for changing jobs in a positive light whenever possible. This way,
                    employers will see your career moves as thoughtful and driven by a desire to improve and
                    succeed.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Highlight Your Positive Qualities</h3>
                <p>
                    Hiring managers think that job-hoppers won’t stay at their company for very long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you’ve switched jobs frequently in the past, it’s important to explain that you’re
                    dedicated and won’t jump ship by emphasizing your skills and what makes you a unique fit
                    for the role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mention how you job hopped in the past to gain new experience and skills, and show how
                    those roles prepared you to transition into a more stable position.
                </p>
                <p>Here’s how you might positively express your reasons for job hopping in a cover letter:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    “I’ve purposefully sought roles that offered opportunities for learning and advancement,
                    with each position strategically chosen to deepen my expertise and enhance my
                    contributions to the field. My career moves have been driven by a desire to grow and
                    excel. Now, I’m looking for a place where I can settle in, apply what I’ve learned, and
                    continue growing, contributing to a team and company over the long haul.”
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Job Hop Responsibly</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re in the position to change jobs but are worried about how it will look on your
                    resume in future interviews, here are some guidelines to help you job-hop responsibly.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Plan Your Transition Strategically</h3>
                <p>
                    Trevor Bogan, Regional Director at Top Employers Institute, points out that if you’re
                    considering changing jobs, it’s important to consider both the timing and the reasons
                    behind your decision. He says:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Job-hopping is still an acceptable practice and has increased significantly since the
                    pandemic. The labor market has been very tight, candidates are looking to increase
                    salaries to combat inflation, and people’s professional networks are so vast with social
                    media that new opportunities can come to someone faster than ever.
                    <footer>Trevor Bogan, Regional Director at Top Employers Institute</footer>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Because new opportunities can arise quickly, job hopping may be a smart idea especially
                    if it leads to an immediate pay raise, or a clear upward career move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, you should think twice about taking a similar position at a new
                    company without a raise or promotion, because one or more instances of this kind of
                    career sidestep on a resume signals instability to hiring managers.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Don’t Burn Bridges</h3>
                <p>
                    When you’re considering switching jobs, it’s important to do it in a way that won’t cause
                    problems or burn bridges with your current employer by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicating openly</li>
                    <li>Providing notice</li>
                    <li>Helping with the transition</li>
                    <li>Staying professional</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Discuss your career goals openly and clearly with your manager when planning to change
                    jobs. Providing notice ahead of time will go a long way in maintaining your professional
                    working relationship, and they may even make you a counter offer.
                </p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h3>1. What is job-hopping?</h3>
                <p>
                    Job-hopping refers to staying at a position less than 1-2 years, as well as frequently
                    changing jobs or companies. While some employers see it as a potential commitment issue,
                    job-hopping can also be viewed as a way to build skills, gain varied experience, and
                    advance your career.
